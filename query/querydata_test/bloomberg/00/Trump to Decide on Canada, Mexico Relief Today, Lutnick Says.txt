President Donald Trump is set to announce changes to the tariffs on Canada and Mexico this afternoon as he considers rolling back the rate on sectors like autos, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television Wednesday morning.
Trump is expected to make a decision on the matter this afternoon, Lutnick added, reiterating that the administration’s tariff policy would be re-evaluated on April 2 to include larger swaths of imports and reciprocal levies. 
“There are going to be tariffs — let’s be clear — but what he’s thinking about is which sections of the market that maybe he’ll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2,” Lutnick said. “I think it is going to be in the middle somewhere.”
The administration will consider providing relief by lowering the levels of the tariffs for specific products that are compliant with regulations under the USMCA deal that Trump negotiated in his first term with Canada and Mexico.
