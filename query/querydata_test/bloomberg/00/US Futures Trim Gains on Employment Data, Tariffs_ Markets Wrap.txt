US stock futures pared gains as weak employment data and concern about Donald Trump’s trade tariffs weighed on markets. European equities surged and bunds tumbled on Germany’s spending plans. 
Contracts on the S&P 500 index were little changed and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.3% after hiring at US companies slowed in February to the lowest pace since July. Two-year Treasury yields rose seven basis points and the dollar sank 0.5%.
US equities capped their worst two-day slump since December on Tuesday after the tariffs were unleashed. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Wednesday the US was aiming for “somewhere in the middle” on the Mexico and Canada levies, and that a decision was expected in the afternoon.
“The market doesn’t like uncertainty and tariffs will most likely continue to be an overhang risk,” Nataliia Lipikhina, EMEA equity strategy head at JPMorgan Private Bank, said on Bloomberg TV. “But if we are looking at earnings growth in the US, we actually see double-digit growth in 2025 and 2026. We are buyers of the dip at this point.”
In Europe, the Stoxx 600 benchmark jumped 1.5% and bonds tumbled after chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz outlined a sweeping fiscal overhaul that could boost the European economy. A sale of new 30-year bunds attracted solid demand.

Speculation that more spending will fan inflation — requiring tighter policy from the European Central Bank — lifted the euro toward its best three-day run since November 2022 and sent 10-year bond yields 20 basis points higher in France, Italy and Spain.
“Huge quantities of debt in the coming years is going to be quite disruptive for European bond markets, particularly the long end of the curve,” said Peter Kinsella, global head of FX strategy at Union Bancaire Privee Ubp SA in London. “We’ve not seen this type of issuance pretty much since the early 1990s when Germany was paying for reunification.”China Growth
Hong Kong shares outperformed after the National People’s Congress in Beijing set an economic growth target of about 5% for 2025, the third straight year it has maintained that goal. Given the broadening global uncertainty on tariffs and geopolitics, economists expect Chinese officials to add stimulus.
On the corporate front, Blackrock Inc., the world’s biggest asset manager, led a consortium that will buy a controlling stake in Panama ports and a larger unit that has operations across 23 countries. It’s one of the biggest acquisitions of the year that marks a win for Trump, who had raised concerns over control of key ports near the Panama Canal.
