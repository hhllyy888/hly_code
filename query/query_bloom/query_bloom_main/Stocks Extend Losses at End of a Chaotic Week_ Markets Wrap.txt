    "content": "Stocks slid further, adding to losses after a $2.5 trillion wipeout of US equities and putting the MSCI global benchmark on track for the biggest weekly loss in seven months. Treasuries rallied and the dollar steadied.\nAgainst a backdrop of an intensifying global trade war, as well as the monthly jobs report and a speech by Federal Reserve ChairJerome Powelllater today, investors were in no mood to take any chances. S&P 500 futures dipped 0.4% in early trading and Europeâ€™s Stoxx 600 index sank 1.2%. The US 10-year bond yield fell below 4%."
