    "content": "key point \nNow that President Donald Trump has set out his landmark tariff plans, the Federal Reserve finds itself in a potential policy box.\nThe central bank is tasked with full employment and low prices. If tariffs challenge both, choosing whether to ease to support growth or tighten to fight inflation won't be easy.\nThe general consensus is that unless the duties are negotiated lower, they will take growth down to near zero or perhaps even into recession, while putting core inflation in 2025 north of 3%.\nNow that President Donald Trump has set out his landmark tariff plans, the Federal Reserve finds itself in a potential policy box, having to choose between fighting inflation, boosting growth â€” or simply avoiding the fray and letting events take their course without intervention.\nShould the president hold fast to his tougher-than-expected trade policy, there's a material risk of at least near-term costs, namely the potential for higher prices and a slowdown in growth that could turn into a recession.\nFor the Fed, that presents a potential no-win situation.\nThe central bank is tasked with using its policy levers to ensure full employment and low prices, the so-called dual mandate of which policymakers speak. If tariffs present challenges to both, choosing whether to ease to support growth or to tighten to fight inflation won't be easy, as each courts its own peril.\n\"The problem for the Fed is that they're going to have to be very reactive,\" said Jonathan Pingle, chief U.S. economist at UBS. \"They're going to be watching prices rise, which might make them hesitant to respond to any growth weakness that materializes. I think it's certainly going to make it very hard for them to be preemptive.\"\nUnder normal conditions, the Fed likes to get ahead of things.\nIf it sees leading gauges of unemployment perk up, the Fed will cut interest rates to ease financial conditions and give companies more incentive to hire. If it sniffs out a coming rise in inflation, it can raise rates to dampen demand and bring down prices.\nSo what happens when both things occur at the same time?"
