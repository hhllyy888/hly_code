    "content": "key point \nPresident Donald Trump’s new policies put the effective tariff rate above the level of around 20% set by 1930’s Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, according to Sarah Bianchi, a strategist at Evercore ISI.\nAn estimate from Fitch Ratings said that the tariff rate would hit its highest level since 1909.\nThe full economic impact of the new duties will likely depend on how long they are in place and whether other nations retaliate.\nThe tariff policy outlined by President Donald Trump on Wednesday appears set to raise the level of U.S. import duties to the highest in more than 100 years.\nThe U.S. introduced a baseline 10% tariff on imports, but also steep country-by-country rates on some major trading partners, including China. The country-by-country rates appear to be related to the trade deficit the U.S. has with each trading partner.\nSarah Bianchi, Evercore ISI chief strategist of international political affairs and public policy, said in a note to clients late Wednesday that the new policies put the effective tariff rate above the level of around 20% set by 1930's Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which is often cited by economists as a contributing factor to the Great Depression."
