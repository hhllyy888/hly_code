    "content": "key point \nShares of China's BYD rallied on Tuesday after the company announced a new technology that it claims can charge electric vehicles almost as quickly as it takes to fill a gasoline car.\nBYD on Monday unveiled a new \"Super e-Platform\" technology, which it says will be capable of peak charging speeds of 1,000 kilowatts. \nThe EV giant and Tesla rival says this will allow cars that use the technology to achieve 400 kilometers (roughly 249 miles) of range with just 5 minutes of charging.\nShares of China's BYD rallied on Tuesday after the company announced a new technology that it claims can charge electric vehicles (EV) almost as quickly as it takes to fill a gasoline car.\nBYD's Hong Kong-listed shares jumped more than 6% shortly after the open, notching a new a 52-week high. The stock, which was last seen trading around 4.2% higher, is up over 50% year-to-date.\nBYD's Shenzen-listed stock price, meanwhile, rose over 2% on Tuesday morning, before paring some of its gains.\nIt comes shortly after BYD unveiled a new \"Super e-Platform\" technology, which it says will be capable of peak charging speeds of 1,000 kilowatts. The EV giant and Tesla rival says this will allow cars that use the technology to achieve 400 kilometers (roughly 249 miles) of range with just 5 minutes of charging.\nCNBC could not independently verify these claims.\nBy contrast, Tesla's latest superchargers offer a charging rate of up to 500 kilowatts, and can add up to 270 kilometers of range in 15 minutes. Germany's Mercedes-Benz Group, meanwhile, said last week that its all-electric CLA will be able to recharge up to 325 kilometers within 10 minutes.\n\"The ultimate solution is to make charging as quick as refueling a gasoline car,\" Wang Chuanfu, chairman and president of BYD, said at the launch event, according to a press release.\nThe breakthrough appears to cut to the core of range anxiety, one of the major sticking points preventing consumers from switching to an EV. Range anxiety refers to fears that an electric car battery will run out of charge before the passenger reaches the destination.\nXing Lei, an independent China autos analyst, described the technological advancements of BYD's new battery platform as \"out of this world\" and a \"heartbreaking\" development for its foreign competitors.\n\"Just when everybody's focus seems to be turning toward smartification, BYD comes right back and says: no no, we are not done with electrification yet,\" Lei said in a LinkedIn post."
