    "content": "key point \nFood and consumer business CEOs say tariffs on a wide range of countries will pressure thin margins in an economy where inflation is already elevated unlike the 2017-2018 trade war.\n\"I am at a point with my business where I can finally put my foot on the gas but now I don't know if it's going to be feasible to keep the business going,\" said Anjali Bhargava, founder of spice company Anjali's Cup. \"Heartbreaking,\" the small business owner said.\nThe Consumer Brands Association, a major food industry trade group, says its member companies largely support \"America First\" and many manufacture in rural parts of the the U.S., but their supply chains are global, \"incredibly tapped out\" and with any cost hikes \"there is nowhere to absorb it.\"\nFear of rising supply chain costs as a result of President Donald Trump's new tariffs expected to be implemented Wednesday — \"Liberation Day,\" as Trump calls it — have small to medium-sized businesses turning down opportunities to expand their market share with too much economic uncertainty surrounding prices in the near future. On Tuesday, Trump said the tariffs plan is ready and the administration said the trade taxes will take effect \"immediately.\"\n\"This is heartbreaking,\" said Anjali Bhargava, founder of Anjali's Cup, which makes retail spice packages.\nBhargava's Ayurveda-inspired turmeric and chai blends — made with spices sourced from Vietnam, Thailand, Africa, and South America; tea and peppercorn from India; safran from Afghanistan; and special retail tin packaging made in China — are sold through retailers including Whole Foods, and there is little room for major price changes.\n\"My margins are thin,\" Bhargava said. \"The people I'm working with, independent foreign farmers securing their 2024 spice harvest, these are spices not grown at the scale I need here in the United States.\"\nThe threat of the global tariffs already have the small business owner rethinking plans for core marketing efforts. In June, the Specialty Food Association's big event takes place, the SFA Summer Fancy Food Show, but Bhargava said she may not attend because the packaging she needs for products may no longer be available at a price that can be absorbed.\n\"I have bootstrapped with pivots, but this is so challenging, I am at a point with my business where I can finally put my foot on the gas but now I don't know if it's going to be feasible to keep the business going,\" said Bhargava."
