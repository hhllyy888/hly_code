Trump this week said he might reduce China tariffs to help close a deal that forces Beijing-based ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations.\nThe U.S. this week also added dozens of Chinese tech companies to its export blacklist, the first such restrictions under the Trump administration.\nChina has increased its trade with Southeast Asian countries and the European Union, but the U.S. remains Beijing's largest trading partner on a single-country basis.\nXi said U.S.-China trade tensions should be resolved through negotiations. \"We need to work for the stability of global supply chains,\" he added, noting there was no way out under decoupling.\nPolitburo standing committee member Cai Qi, China's top diplomat Wang Yi and Vice Premier He Lifeng also attended the meeting along with the heads of China's economic planning agency, finance ministry and commerce ministry.\nSeven foreign executives spoke at the event before Xi gave closing remarks, according to an agenda seen by CNBC.\nXi gave individualized comments on the speaker's remarks based on past history with the person or the company, according to Stephen Orlins, president of the National Committee on US-China Relations.\nOrlins pointed out that the companies present at the meeting already had interests in China.\nBeijing has sought to offset trade pressures, rather than retaliate forcefully. It courted the executives of major U.S. businesses at a state-backed annual conference that ran from Sunday to Monday. Apple CEO Tim Cook was among those who attended the conference, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk was conspicuous by his absence. Neither were at Friday's meeting with Xi.\nAlso on Sunday, U.S. Republican Senator Steve Daines met Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing — the first time a U.S. politician has visited China since Trump began his latest term in January.\n\"This was the first step to an important next step, which will be a meeting between President Xi and President Trump,\" Daines told the Wall Street Journal. \"When that occurs and where it occurs is to be determined.\"\nThe White House did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nLi urged cooperation and said no one could gain from a trade war, according to state media.\nTop executives of major firms including FedEx, Pfizer, Cargill, Qualcomm and Boeing as well as U.S.-China Business Council President Sean Stein were also present at Daines' meeting with Li, according to a foreign media pool report."
