Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nZeekr's version will be free, rolled out to a pilot group initially and then released to the public in April, according to the company.\n\"Right now, in this period of development, I think subscriptions aren't that meaningful,\" CEO An said in an interview Friday, according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks.\nGiven intense competition, he said, Zeekr needs to close the gap on driver assistance with market leaders and become a top player. \"So we need to bear some cost,\" An said, noting Zeekr previously only offered more basic driver-assistance capabilities, such as for parking."
