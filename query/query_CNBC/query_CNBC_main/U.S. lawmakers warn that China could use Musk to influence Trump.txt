    "content": "The Republican and Democratic leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives' select committee on China warned on Tuesday that Beijing may try to exert leverage with Elon Musk in a bid to win favorable U.S. policies, and that Washington must counter any such effort.\nRepublican committee chair John Moolenaar and Democratic ranking member Raja Krishnamoorthi said they believed the Chinese Communist Party wants to use U.S. business leaders including Musk, who have commercial interests in China, to advance its goals in talks with Washington.\n\"To the question of Elon Musk, I do believe that the CCP will try and leverage any opportunity,\" Moolenaar told an event hosted by the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington.\n\"Are people going to be looking for that and make sure that his lane is one that is not influencing China policy? I believe that is the case,\" Moolenaar said, when asked whether Congress has a role in preventing Beijing from negotiating with the White House through Musk.\nMusk and the White House did not respond immediately to requests for comment. China's Washington embassy said China welcomed \"mutually beneficial cooperation\" with \"people from all walks of life in the United States.\"\n\"We are happy to see foreign-funded enterprises invest and start businesses in China, deepen their presence in the Chinese market and share development opportunities,\" embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said by email.\nChina has some pressing priorities. Just over a month into his second term, President Donald Trump has announced additional 10% tariffs on Chinese goods, called for greater restrictions on Chinese investment in the U.S., and named China hardliners to key posts.\nMusk, the world's richest man and among Trump's biggest donors in the 2024 election, could be attractive to Beijing as a potential conduit to Trump because he has become one of the president's closest White House advisers.\nTrump named Musk to lead an effort to radically downsize the federal government."
