    "content": "key point \nSingapore is more expensive than other Southeast Asian cities, so it's using world-class attractions, business conferences and live events to attract visitors.\nThe Singapore Tourism Board said it will continue to support projects that deliver interactive experiences in line with the global shift towards experiential travel.\nVisitor arrivals are projected to grow to between 17 million and 18.5 million this year, boosted by lifestyle and business events, as well as new attractions like Rainforest Wild Asia and the Disney Adventure cruise ship.\nBritish national Tony Cross first set foot in Singapore in 1992, when the city-state's main draws were its glitzy malls, the pulsating Zouk nightclub and the renowned Singapore Zoo.\nToday, shopping has taken a backseat, as prices for goods have climbed alongside commercial rents in a city where space is scarce. And, Singapore's once-thriving clubbing industry is facing tough times, hurt by high costs and shifting alcohol consumption habits.\nCompetition from other Southeast Asian cities, which are far cheaper to visit, is heating up too.\nRather than competing on price, Singapore is relying on world-class attractions like Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay and the expanding Mandai Wildlife Reserve to draw both budget and luxury travelers alike.\nOthers arrive for business conferences and live events, from the annual Formula One night race to concerts by megastars like Taylor Swift and Coldplay. This year, Singapore is hosting concerts by Lady Gaga on May 18, 19, 21 and 24 — her only stop in Asia-Pacific — according to Singapore Airlines, whose reward program, KrisFlyer, is a concert partner.\n\"Singapore built itself a brilliant position as accessible Southeast Asia in the '80s and '90s. But many other cities in the region have now upped their game, too,\" said Cross, a financial consultant who has visited the island nation some 20 times over the last three decades."
