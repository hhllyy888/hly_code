Then the direction is not clear and if, for example, we conclude that the effects on confidence are persistent (,..) we would have to make decisions accordingly,\" he said.\nIn the case of Spain, Escriva said the central bank would revise downwards its growth forecasts for the Spanish economy this year, without saying by how much. He added job creation could also be hit.\nLast month, the Bank of Spain said it expected the country's economy to expand by a strong 2.7% this year, up from the 2.5% forecast in its previous quarterly update. Its forecast at the time had not taken into account any effect of recent geopolitical tensions."
