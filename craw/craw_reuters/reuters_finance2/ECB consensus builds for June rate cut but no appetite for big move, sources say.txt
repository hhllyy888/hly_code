The ECB trimmed its benchmark rate to 2.25% earlier this month.\nIn line with the ECB's official line, they were keeping an open mind, however, given that the decision was still more than a month away and economic policy had become unpredictable since Donald Trump's April 2 announcement.\nAn ECB spokesperson declined to comment.\nTrump's move shook investor confidence in the U.S. economy and even its status as the world's safe haven, causing fuel prices as well as the dollar to fall against the euro.\nThis resulted in growing disinflationary pressure in the euro zone, assuaging concerns about high price growth becoming entrenched among even some of the more hawkish members of the ECB's Governing Council.\nThe outlook further out remains foggy, however, with the prospect of a more fragmented world, cheaper imports from China and stronger domestic demand from Germany's fiscal spending plans creating contrasting forces.\nFor this reason, too, policymakers who spoke to Reuters saw no reason at present to consider a bigger, 50-basis-point cut, which they also believed might raise unnecessary alarm among market participants."
