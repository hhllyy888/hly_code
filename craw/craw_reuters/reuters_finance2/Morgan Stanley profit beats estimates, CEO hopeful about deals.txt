Still, companies have not given up on them, he said.\n\"We are still, I will call it 'cautiously optimistic' that we won’t go into recession,\" Pick said. CFO Sharon Yeshaya added that the bank's pipeline of potential transactions remains strong and has not been reduced.\nCorporations may look at potential tax cuts and deregulation and decide to proceed with deals even as volatility rises, Pick said.\nThe bank earned $4.3 billion, or $2.60 per share, in the three months ended March 31. That compares with a profit of $3.4 billion, or $2.02 per share, a year ago. Analysts expected earnings per share of $2.20, according to estimates compiled by LSEG.\nShares were down 0.8% in midday trading.\nMorgan Stanley's investment banking revenue rose 8% from a year earlier, bolstered by higher advisory and fixed income underwriting revenue.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose heavy tariffs and the launch of China's generative AI model, DeepSeek, triggered a broad selloff in global markets. Potential for a recession and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's interest-rate trajectory have kept investors on edge.\nEquity trading revenue rose as investors rebalanced their portfolios, boosting volumes, mainly in technology and industrial stocks.\nFixed income trading revenue increased, as renewed concerns about stagflation due to tariffs led investors to hedge aggressively and change the types of bonds they held, and over what periods.\nWall Street's investment banks face a murky dealmaking climate.\nA rebound in Asia helped lift global M&A volumes in the first quarter, but U.S. activity — a key revenue driver for firms such as Morgan Stanley — slumped 13% amid growing uncertainty, according to Dealogic data.\nEquity underwriting revenues fell as issuers and investors considered market uncertainty.\nBankers and analysts warn the prolonged trade war, disappointing IPO debuts and weak follow-through on major deals could dampen investor sentiment and advisory pipelines in the second quarter.\nStable markets support deal activity by giving buyers and sellers more confidence around valuations, reducing execution risk and encouraging companies to move ahead with transactions.\nMorgan Stanley ranked fourth globally in investment banking fees in the first quarter, according to Dealogic data.\nThe bank advised on several big transactions in the quarter, including Walgreens' $24 billion take-private deal with Sycamore Partners. It also served as lead underwriter for AI cloud firm CoreWeave's $1.5 billion U.S. initial public offering.\nMorgan Stanley's Institutional Securities business, which houses investment banking and trading, reported revenue of $9 billion compared with $7 billion a year earlier.\nMorgan Stanley booked a profit from the sale in the first quarter of the loan that financed the 2022 acquisition of social media platform X, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.\nThe bank led the syndicate of lenders that included Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, MUFG, Mizuho and Societe Generale that kept the $13 billion in loans on their balance sheets for more than two years.\nThe profit was booked as other revenue in the bank's Institutional Securities division, which reached $692 million, more than doubled the $242 million in revenue from a year ago.\nElsewhere, JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), opens new tab and Wells Fargo's (WFC.N), opens new tab profits beat forecasts, but executives warned that sweeping tariffs could fuel risks and weigh on economic growth.\nMorgan Stanley's wealth management revenue - a key area of focus - came in at $7.3 billion, compared with $6.9 billion a year ago."
