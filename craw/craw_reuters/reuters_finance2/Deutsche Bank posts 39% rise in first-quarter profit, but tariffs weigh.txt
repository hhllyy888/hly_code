Deutsche has now cumulatively earned more in profit than it has lost over the last 10 years, and has made up for the hefty losses it posted between the years 2015 and 2019.\nAnalysts with Barclays called the results \"good enough for the shares to outperform slightly\". Shares opened 2.9% higher.\nRevenue in Deutsche's fixed-income and currency trading, one of the bank's largest businesses, rose 17%, better than expectations for a 10.3% gain. JPMorgan analysts called those results the best among Deutsche's global competitors.\nHowever, origination and advisory, after making big gains in recent quarters, saw an 8% drop in revenue. It posted a 90 million euros writedown for an unnamed position in its leveraged finance business.\nDeutsche is one of several big European banks publishing its quarterly report card this week after a slew of strong earnings from their U.S. counterparts.\nAfter U.S. President Donald Trump unleashed a global trade war earlier this month, investors are watching how banks plan to navigate an anticipated slowdown in economic growth that could hit loan demand and their customers' financial health.\n\"We have taken additional provisions to cover higher macroeconomic uncertainties caused by the tariff discussions and, as a result, our overall provisions were higher year-on-year,\" Sewing wrote in a memo to staff.\nDeutsche operates from Sydney to New York, but the economy of its important home market in Germany has been stagnating.\nThe nation's top central banker warned last week that the German economy, Europe's largest, faces a possible slight recession in 2025, something that could eat into banks' profits and result in loan defaults by corporate clients.\nAs Sewing strives to meet his ambitious profit and cost targets, some analysts remain sceptical about the bank's ability to meet all its goals. In January, Deutsche abandoned a key cost target.\nStill, Germany's bold move to ease longstanding caps on government spending has been seen as a positive for the lender and economic growth.\n($1 = 0.8782 euros)"
