It began a push for a potential pan-European bank merger last year, leaving Germany's corporate and political establishment shocked.\nUniCredit's interest swiftly sparked concern among employees as well as Commerzbank management and top German government officials.\nKevin Voss, a Verdi union leader, said he feared massive job cuts in the case of a takeover.\nUniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel's pursuit of Commerzbank has become a test of Germany's resolve to fend off foreign suitors and prevent its financial centre in Frankfurt from losing one of the few remaining big commercial banks.\nUniCredit declined to comment on the protests and on how it would vote at the shareholder meeting.\nBig shareholders speaking on Thursday supported Commerzbank's strategy and did not openly call for talks with UniCredit.\nBut Hendrik Schmidt of the fund manager DWS said that cooperations \"shouldn't be taboo\".\nAlexandra Annecke, with the fund manager Union Investment, said that a higher valuation at Commerzbank could help it secure \"more strategic options\".\nLast week, Commerzbank reported that net profit rose nearly 12% in the first quarter, beating expectations despite strong challenges for the German economy.\nAndreas Thomae, of Deka Investment, praised Commerzbank for making strides in increasing profit and warned that a UniCredit takeover should not happen \"at any price\".\nKlaus Nieding of the shareholder lobby group DSW said he was firmly against a takeover.\n\"Mega-mergers have rarely paid off for us shareholders in the past,\" he said."
