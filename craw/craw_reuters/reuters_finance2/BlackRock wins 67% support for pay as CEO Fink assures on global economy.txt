Investors want to be optimistic but there's still quite a bit of anxiety and uncertainty. The market's disruption this year is different than we've seen in shocks since the financial crisis. There isn't systemic risk. There isn't a pandemic. Our financial system is safe and sound,\" he said.\nLike rivals, BlackRock become more supportive of environmental, social and governance issues starting in 2020, then walked back many of those steps under pressure from U.S. conservatives. During the meeting, Fink said BlackRock only seeks to reflect client wishes.\nAs a result of client choices, \"we are the largest investor in both hydrocarbons and the largest investor in renewables,\" he said.\nA conservative-backed resolution critical of BlackRock's approach to ESG won only 1% support, the company said during the meeting. Each of its 18 director nominees were easily elected with average support over 98%."
