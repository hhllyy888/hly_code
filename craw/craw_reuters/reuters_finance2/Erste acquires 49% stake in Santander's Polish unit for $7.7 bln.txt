This payout would accelerate the delivery of its up to 10 billion share buyback target for 2025 and 2026.\nErste Group's funding of the acquisition is supported by the cancellation of a 700-million euro share buyback programme, temporarily reduced dividend payout ratio and various balance sheet optimisation measures, it said.\n($1 = 0.8835 euros)"
