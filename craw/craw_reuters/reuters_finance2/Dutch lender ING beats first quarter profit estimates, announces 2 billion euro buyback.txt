In a press release on Friday it said it aimed to reach 12.8% to 13% by the year's end, up from the 12.5% previously iterated.\nVan Rijswijk said he still wanted to reach that target later down the line, but had delayed the guidance taking the \"macroeconomic uncertainty into account\".\nQuarterly commercial net-interest income, under pressure across the board as the region's central bank continues to cut interest rates, clocked in at 3.79 billion euros, in-line with expectations.\nING's merger strategy stayed unchanged as the bank and other lenders saw 2025 as the year of consolidation opportunities coupled with distribution of profits to its shareholders.\n\"We will, of course, take the uncertainty into account ... but it has not taken our eyes away looking from looking at M&A opportunities itself,\" van Rijswijk said.\n($1 = 0.8846 euros)"
