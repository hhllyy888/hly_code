The increase is related to a few counterparties, in different industries and countries.\"\nThe more than 165-year-old bank reported net expected credit losses of 663 million crowns compared to 73 million a year ago and the 352 million seen by analysts.\nThe bank, part of the investment sphere centred on Sweden's Wallenberg business family, affirmed its cost target of around 33 billion crowns for the full year as investments across its business drive an increase from last year's 31 billion.\n($1 = 9.6000 Swedish crowns)"
