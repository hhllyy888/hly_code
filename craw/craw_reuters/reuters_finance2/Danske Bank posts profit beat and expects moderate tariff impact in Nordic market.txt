They traded 3.6% higher at 0711 GMT on Friday, topping the STOXX Europe 600 index (.STOXX), opens new tab.\nThe bank still expects net profit for the year of between 21 billion and 23 billion crowns, slightly lower than in 2024, primarily due to lower net interest income from lower market rates.\nThe region's biggest lender Nordea (NDAFI.HE), opens new tab last month also reported forecast-beating profits.\nDanske Bank said it took an impairment charge of 50 million crowns in the first three months of the year, compared with the 195 million expected by analysts.\nNet interest income, a metric for measuring banks' income from lending and deposits, fell 1% to 9.02 billion in the first quarter but was above the 8.86 billion forecast by analysts.\nNet fee income rose 8% to 3.66 billion, compared with the 3.57 billion predicted by analysts.\n\"We delivered solid results in line with our expectations, driven by a steady development in core income and a stable cost level,\" CEO Carsten Egeriis said in a statement.\n\"In addition, credit quality remained strong, and this resulted in low loan impairments,\" he said."
