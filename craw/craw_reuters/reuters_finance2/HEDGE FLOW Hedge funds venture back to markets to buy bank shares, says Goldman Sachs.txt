    "content": "LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - Hedge funds returned into markets last week to buy bank stocks having sold out of positions for eight straight weeks, a Goldman Sachs note shows.\nFinancial firms including U.S. banks became the second-most net bought stock behind real estate this year, said the note released on Friday and seen by Reuters on Tuesday.\nThat move came as markets digested what the largest U.S. banks had to say in their first-quarter earnings reports.\nTrading desks at JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), opens new tab and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), opens new tab brought in record revenue as markets boomed early in the year, while Wells Fargo (WFC.N), opens new tab earned more fees from clients quarterly presentations showed.\nHedge fund positions in financials as an overall stock sector reached a two-year high, said Goldman Sachs.\nHedge funds have taken mostly long positions on these financials stocks for five of the last seven weeks, said the note added. A long bet expects a stock price to rise.\nThis kind of buying outpaced the smaller number of hedge fund trades that were the result of hedge funds buying stock to exit short bets. A trader borrows stock in order to short it, or bet that it will decline in value, after which, the trader buys it back again.\nWhile capital markets firms and banks took up most hedge fund buying last week, financial services firms that facilitate trading were the most bought kind of financial stock this year so far, said Goldman Sachs.\nGlobal stock picking hedge fund performance rose over 2% between April 18 and 24, and systematic traders posted a 0.44% performance increase during the same time period, said the note."
