    "content": "May 5 (Reuters) - A Credit Suisse unit on Monday pleaded guilty to U.S. charges of helping ultra-wealthy Americans evade taxes and will pay a fine of more than $510 million, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Monday.\nCredit Suisse Services AG pleaded guilty and was sentenced on Monday for conspiring to hide more than $4 billion from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in at least 475 offshore accounts, the department said.\nThe guilty plea stems from the Swiss bank maintaining accounts in Singapore on behalf of U.S. taxpayers who were using offshore accounts to evade U.S. taxes and reporting requirements, according to the release.\n\"Among other fraudulent acts, bankers at Credit Suisse falsified records, processed fictitious donation paperwork, and serviced more than $1 billion in accounts without documentation of tax compliance,\" the Justice Department said. \"In doing so, Credit Suisse AG committed new crimes and breached its May 2014 plea agreement with the United States.\"\nIn 2014, Credit Suisse became the largest bank in 20 years to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge, agreeing to pay a $2.5 billion fine for helping Americans evade taxes in a conspiracy that spanned decades.\nPrior to Monday's settlement, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee in 2023 had found Credit Suisse violated its 2014 deal made with U.S. authorities by continuing to help with the tax evasion and concealing more than $700 million from the government.\nUBS (UBSG.S), opens new tab said on Monday that Credit Suisse Services AG pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to aid and assist in the preparation of false income tax returns.\nUBS said it was not involved in the underlying conduct, which began before its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023.\nThe Swiss lender had accounted for the issue as a contingent liability when acquiring Credit Suisse, and expects this to be partially released as a credit in the second quarter.\nSimultaneously, the bank also expects to record a charge related to the payment in the quarter.\nIn addition to the guilty plea and fine, Credit Suisse Services entered into a non-prosecution agreement that requires it and UBS to cooperate with investigations and affirmatively disclose any information it may later uncover regarding U.S.-related accounts, the Justice Department said."
