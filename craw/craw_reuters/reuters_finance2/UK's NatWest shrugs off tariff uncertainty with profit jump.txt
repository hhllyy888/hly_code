The stock has risen more than 22% so far in 2025 but, at 486.5 pence, remains some way short of its 502 pence bailout price.\nThwaite told reporters he felt confident NatWest could use excess capital to grow its business organically after completing a deal to buy Sainsbury's Bank (SBRY.L), opens new tab on Thursday that added 2.5 billion pounds in customer loans and 1 million customer accounts. Fresh dealmaking faced \"a very high bar\", he said.\nThe results come as NatWest prepares to return fully to private ownership for the first time since its state rescue at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe bank's chairman earlier in April said the lender's upcoming exit from state ownership represents an inflection point for the bank, as it pivots from years of post-crisis restructuring to a domestic growth-focused strategy.\nThe government's stake in NatWest fell below 2% on Thursday. It has cut its shareholding from nearly 40% in December 2023. Thwaite said the board would review potential for share buybacks at the half-year.\nThe domestic focus has so far insulated NatWest from the deepening global trade tensions, although it is on alert for economic shocks across Britain, where business sentiment has fallen to its lowest in three months, and the government has put pressure on the financial sector to support its growth agenda.\nNatWest booked a net impairment charge of 189 million pounds, with default levels at 19 basis points of the overall loan book, within its guidance of under 20 basis points, and said levels of default were stable.\nKBW Analysts noted there were no additional impairments for tariff-related risks, but Thwaite and Chief Financial Officer Katie Murray told reporters they were confident NatWest was comfortably positioned in terms of provisions.\nAround 70% of the bank's corporate credit exposure was to the services sector, which is so far less impacted by tariffs, Murray said. Customers exporting to the U.S. accounted for a low single-digit percentage of lending and assets, Thwaite added.\nBank of England data on Thursday showed a surge in mortgage borrowing in the first quarter as buyers pushed to seal property purchases before a change in UK stamp duty taxes.\nQuilter Cheviot analysts said they expected the spike in borrowing to be anomalous, with an equally sharp slowdown likely in the coming months.\n($1 = 0.7512 pounds)"
