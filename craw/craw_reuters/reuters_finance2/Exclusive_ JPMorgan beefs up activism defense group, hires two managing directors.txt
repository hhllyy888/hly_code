Brian Frank, a JPMorgan veteran, will also be joining the group.\nThe newcomers will work with the global co-heads of the group: Alfredo Porretti and Darren Novak, and report to John Hofmann, head of North America M&A. They will be based in New York.\nThe hires represent the biggest expansion of the team in a decade and come as activism defense, once a nice-to-have add-on service, is now a lucrative business that major investment banks and many boutiques are scrambling to offer clients.\nLast year, a record number of activist shareholders mounted campaigns at global companies, including 45 who deployed the strategy for the first time, according to Barclays data.\nJPMorgan confirmed the contents of the memo. Herrington and Park could not be immediately reached for comment.\nHerrington, a lawyer, was a managing partner at Jasper Street where he helped the firm's clients defend against corporate activists. Previously he worked as a defense banker at Moelis (MC.N), opens new tab and Raymond James Financial (RJF.N), opens new tab.\nPark joined ICR in 2018 to advise corporate boards on governance matters after serving as head of global corporate governance at Dimensional Fund Advisors and previously working in investment giant BlackRock's (BLK.N), opens new tab Investment Stewardship unit.\nFrank, who has been with JPMorgan for nearly 17 years, focused on M&A Capital Markets and worked with the event driven sales & trading team.\nJPMorgan restructured its efforts to assist clients when activists come knocking in 2020 and has since surged in the league table rankings that count banks' mandates. Last year, it came in second behind Goldman Sachs (GS.N), opens new tab and ahead of Bank of America (BAC.N), opens new tab in Bloomberg's tally of Global Financial Advisers. In 2020, the bank ranked in the No. 8 spot, according to LSEG data.\nLast year, JPMorgan defended Walt Disney (DIS.N), opens new tab when hedge fund Trian Fund Management pushed for board seats. The bank also worked with asset management firm BlackRock (BLK.N), opens new tab when Boaz Weinstein's Saba Capital Management pushed for changes at some of its closed-end funds. And this year it helped Matthews International (MATW.O), opens new tab beat back a board challenge from Barington Capital Group after the two biggest proxy advisory firms recommended that shareholders elect all three of the hedge fund's candidates.\nAs corporate chiefs face tumbling stock prices and uncertainty about new Trump administration policies that could hurt earnings, many feel increasingly vulnerable to activists' demands, bankers and lawyers said. At the same time, the work of defending these corporations is increasingly concentrated among the big banks and a small number of boutiques, accelerating the need for teams to grow in order to win, they added.\nGoldman and Bank of America have both reinforced their efforts over the last few years with Goldman promoting Pamela Codo-Lotti to partner last year and Bank of America hiring Amy Lissauer, who previously worked at Goldman and Evercore, in 2019 to build out the group."
