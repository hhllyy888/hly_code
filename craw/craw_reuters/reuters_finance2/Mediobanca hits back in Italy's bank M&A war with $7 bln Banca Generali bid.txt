The MPS bid should start weeks later.\nThe Banca Generali deal would make wealth management Mediobanca's core business, while the MPS bid would plug Mediobanca's operations, which comprise consumer finance and investment banking, into the Tuscan bank's branch franchise.\nTwo people in MPS' camp said the two projects were not mutually exclusive.\nThe consolidation frenzy shaking Italian banks comes as they brace for falling revenues as interest rates decline. Normally rare in banking, hostile moves have become the norm in Italy.\n\"You know we have been chasing this opportunity for many years,\" Nagel said. \"We have found that at this moment a lot of stars aligned.\"\nCaltagirone last week gained only three Generali board seats despite receiving eleventh hour support from UniCredit (CRDI.MI), opens new tab, which has bought 6.7% of Generali.\nUniCredit's strategy over Generali remains unclear, but bankers say CEO Andrea Orcel could eye wealth management deals with the insurer.\nThat, however, would put UniCredit on a collision course with Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI), opens new tab, Italy's main bank, which is focused on wealth management and insurance.\nIt also requires Generali to ditch a controversial deal with French bank BPCE to merge their asset management operations.\nMediobanca would double its wealth management revenue to 45% of the total. It aims to expand Banca Generali's insurance and asset management partnerships with Generali to the new combined entity.\n\"We would move from a financial to an industrial relationship with Generali,\" Nagel said.\nShares in Generali fell 1.1%, with KBW analysts saying they were \"slightly nervous that Generali is exiting a high growth/high margin arena.\"\nThe exchange offer, which Mediobanca expects to complete by end-October, translates to a deal price of 54.17 euros per share, an 11% premium to Banca Generali's last close.\nShares in Banca Generali rose 5.2%. Mediobanca lost 0.8%.\n\"We're paying more than the stock's record high and more than analysts' price targets,\" Nagel said.\n($1 = 0.8796 euros)"
