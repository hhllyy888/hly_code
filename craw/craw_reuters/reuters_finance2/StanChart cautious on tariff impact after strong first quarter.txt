The benchmark Hang Seng rose 1.7%.\nIts London-listed shares were down 0.8% by 0915 GMT.\nThe bank took a credit impairment of $219 million in the quarter, up 24% from a year earlier. The bank set aside $23 million in relation to the heightened uncertainty around trade tariffs.\nOther major banks have highlighted the threat to economic growth and credit quality from the trade tensions. HSBC (HSBA.L), opens new tab, which reported results earlier this week, forecast worsening loan demand and credit quality in the wake of rising trade tensions.\nStanChart, which focuses on Asia, Africa and the Middle East, reported first-quarter pretax profit of $2.1 billion, versus $1.91 billion a year ago, which was ahead of $1.91 billion forecast by analysts.\nThe results showed \"notable strength\" in the bank's wealth business, Jefferies analysts said in a research note.\n\"We remain of the view that the current tariff uncertainty is ultimately a growth issue not a credit one,\" they said.\nThe bank's wealth business reported 28% first-quarter income growth, while its global markets and global banking businesses delivered increases of 17% and 14% respectively.\nStanChart has said it will target $200 billion in new assets and double-digit growth in income from its wealth business over the next five years, as part of its wider strategy to shift to higher fee-earning businesses.\nStanChart's net interest income in the first three months of this year fell 5% from the previous quarter on a constant currency basis.\nThe bank flagged a challenging outlook for net interest income given the current interest rate environment and economic landscape."
