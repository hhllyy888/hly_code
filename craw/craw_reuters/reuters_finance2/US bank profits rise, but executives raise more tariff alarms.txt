Corporate clients are in a wait-and-see mode, because \"this level of policy uncertainty is one that makes it hard to plan for the long term.\"\nEquity traders at JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), opens new tab and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), opens new tab brought in record revenue as markets boomed early in the year, while Wells Fargo (WFC.N), opens new tab earned more fees from clients. Shares of JPMorgan rose about 3%, Morgan Stanley climbed 0.3% and Wells Fargo fell 2% in afternoon trading.\nCorporations that are set to report their results in the upcoming weeks will probably withdraw their earnings forecasts given the uncertainty, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts.\nThe latest warnings add to a chorus of Wall Street executives ringing alarm bells about the potential economic damage from the tariffs, including Dimon, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman.\n\"I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am,\" Dimon told analysts, referring to IPOs and deals that had already been withdrawn because of economic uncertainty.\nInvestors hoping for an end to wild market swings were reminded with Thursday's stock-market plunge that shifting tariff plans remain a threat to earnings and the economy.\nCorporate and commercial banking clients \"are taking a step back saying, 'you know, I need to get more clarity, certainty about where things are going,'\" Wells Fargo CFO Michael Santomassimo told journalists.\nWells Fargo shares extended losses after the CFO said net interest income - the difference between what the bank earns on loans and pays on deposits - would be in the low end of its guidance this year as markets become more volatile.\n\"If we still have uncertainty in the summer, and I presume we will, you'll see further reserve building by these banks,\" said Chris Marinac, director of research at Janney Montgomery Scott. \"This environment is a little bit easier ... than we had in COVID. You just have a pending trade war, certainly a recession that feels like it's right around the corner, and banks have to address for incremental risk.\"\nMorgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick expressed more optimism than his counterparts, saying the economy could avoid recession, while acknowledging the risks. The bank's deal pipeline remained steady, even though uncertainty had prompted some clients to delay transactions, Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya said.\nInvestment banking was a bright spot across Wall Street, with fees at JPMorgan climbing 12%, while revenue rose 8% at Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said banks could be relatively resilient despite the tariffs.\n\"Right now, this isn't a financial event that's going to be the genesis of the recession, and banks could be the safe space,\" he said.\nExecutives were also quizzed about turmoil in the U.S. Treasuries market, where a searing selloff this week in response to tariffs caused dislocations in the worldâ€™s biggest bond market and raised investor concerns about lasting damage to markets.\nDimon urged regulators to make changes to the supplementary leverage ratio, a rule that requires big U.S. banks to keep an extra layer of loss-absorbing capital. If there was a \"kerfuffle,\" or market disruption, the Federal Reserve would probably step in, but that seems unlikely for now, he said.\nElsewhere on Wall Street, BNY profits surpassed expectations as its assets under custody grew. BlackRock (BLK.N), opens new tab, the world's largest asset manager, said its assets surged to a record $11.58 trillion. Still, its CEO said uncertainty and anxiety were dominating markets.\n\"The emperor has no clothes right now. It's obvious that nobody knows what's coming,\" said Colin White, CEO and portfolio manager at Verecan Capital Management."
