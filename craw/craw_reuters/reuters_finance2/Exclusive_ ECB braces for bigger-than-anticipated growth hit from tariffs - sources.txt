This would essentially wipe out all economic growth since the bloc is only seen expanding by about 1% this year.\nAn ECB spokesperson declined to comment.\nSuch sluggish economic activity may push inflation down rather than up, the sources said. But some argued that greater fragmentation in global trade may result in structurally higher inflation further out.\nEnergy prices are down, the euro is firming and corporate bond yields are up, all contributing to a slowdown in inflation. In addition, international markets, including supposedly safe corners such as U.S. treasuries, are in tumult.\nThese factors will add to the case for another interest rate cut next week, some of the sources said. This move is already fully priced in by money markets.\nA long list of influential policymakers have already backed a rate cut in public commentary and only one, Austria's Robert Holzmann, spoke against a move, which would be the ECB's seventh in the past year.\nAll the sources added that the market turmoil is not impairing the transmission of monetary policy so there was no discussion about any measure to improve liquidity or the flow of credit.\nThey also said there was no discussion about reopening the debate on the ECBâ€™s bond purchases either. The bank is now allowing bonds bought during previous stimulus to expire, shrinking its balance sheet gradually and withdrawing liquidity from the financial system.\nThe sources said this policy remained appropriate and would continue."
