The offshore yuan also gave back about 120 pips of its losses.\nThe PBOC's focus on steady yuan moves comes even as the worsening U.S. trade war severely challenges the competitiveness of China's massive export sector, suggesting financial market stability remains the priority.\nThe PBOC did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment. All the sources spoke on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorised to talk about market matters publicly.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries took effect on Wednesday, including 104% duties on Chinese goods, deepening his global trade war.\nA weaker yuan would make exports cheaper and alleviate some pressure on China's trade and the broader economy, but a sharp depreciation could fuel unwanted capital outflow pressure and risk financial stability, analysts have said.\nSpeculation China's central bank is preparing to allow that perked up this week, after the PBOC slightly loosened its grip on the currency.\nThe bank allowed its official midpoint guidance rate, around which the daily spot rate is allowed to move in a 2% band, to weaken past a key threshold for the first time since 2023.\n\"We are of the view that policymakers may prefer to maintain some degree of measured yuan stability,\" said Christopher Wong, FX and rates strategist at OCBC Bank.\n\"We would continue to monitor the daily fixing trend for indication of policymakers' preference,\" he said.\nMore modest increases in the PBOC's dollar-yuan fixing rates should calm sentiment and provide some reprieve for other heavily sold emerging Asian currencies, he said."
