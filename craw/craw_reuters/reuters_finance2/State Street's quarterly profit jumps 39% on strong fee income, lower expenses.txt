    "content": "April 17 (Reuters) - Custodian bank State Street (STT.N), opens new tab on Thursday reported a 39% jump in first-quarter profit, benefitting from lower expenses and higher fees earned from managing client assets.\nThe bank's assets under custody and administration rose 6% to $46.7 trillion in the three months ended March 31 from a year earlier, driven by higher market levels and flows. Its total fee revenue climbed 6% to $2.57 billion in the quarter.\nHowever, the turmoil in financial markets caused by the uncertainties around U.S. trade policy is expected to hit trust banks' fee income from servicing and asset management businesses.\nAnalysts say State Street is most exposed to the declining markets among trust banks, given that a bigger share of its revenue comes from servicing and asset management.\n\"The world's investors and the global economy are now navigating through a period of geopolitical and government policy uncertainty around trade, deficits, tax, and deregulation,\" CEO Ron O'Hanley said.\n\"The current environment provides a unique opportunity for us to demonstrate the strength and effectiveness of our value proposition to clients.\"\nAnalysts expect the impact to be more visible in the second quarter, given the lagged effect of market weakness.\nState Street's expenses fell 3% to $2.45 billion in the first quarter, helped by the absence of a prior-year one-time charge.\nIts quarterly profit rose to $644 million, or $2.04 per share, from $463 million, or $1.37 per share, a year earlier.\nThe bank's foreign exchange trading services revenue jumped 9.4% to $362 million in the quarter, boosted by higher market volatility.\nRival BNY (BK.N), opens new tab last week beat quarterly profit expectations on higher interest income. Meanwhile, Northern Trust (NTRS.O), opens new tab is set to report its results next week, winding up the earnings season for trust banks.\nState Street's shares have plunged 19% this year, compared with a 10% slide in the benchmark S&P 500 index (.SPX), opens new tab as of last close."
