This keeps investors from piggybacking on Berkshire before it is done buying.\nBerkshire obtained such permission for its investments in Chevron (CVX.N), opens new tab and Chubb , and former investments in Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), opens new tab, IBM (IBM.N), opens new tab and Verizon (VZ.N), opens new tab.\nBerkshire bought $3.18 billion and sold $4.68 billion of equities between January and March, the 10th straight quarter it was a net seller of stocks.\nIt ended March with $347.7 billion of cash and equivalents.\nBerkshire maintained its largest position, a 300 million share stake in Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab worth $66.6 billion.\nIt has also been adding to its stakes in five Japanese trading houses.\nAt Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting on May 3, Buffett downplayed concerns about the cash, saying good investments do not pop up in an orderly fashion.\n\"We would rather have conditions that are developed where we would have like $50 billion\" in cash, he said. \"But that just isn't the way the business works. We have made a lot of money by not wanting to be fully invested at all times.\"\nThe Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns close to 200 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, and many energy, industrial, retail and service companies.\nBuffett, 94, is arguably the world's most famous investor. He is the world's fifth-richest person, with a $157.8 billion fortune, according to Forbes magazine.\nAbel, 62, is expected to become Berkshire chief executive on January 1, 2026. Buffett would remain chairman."
