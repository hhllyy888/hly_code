Venkatakrishnan said Barclays had no plans to announce further branch closures this year or next, in response to a question on its shrinking high street presence.\nThe bank also fielded questions on its approach to net zero goals, deforestation and financing of carbon-intensive energy production and supply.\nHiggins said the bank finances fracking in the United States but was not prepared to invest in the creation of a new fracking industry in Britain.\nAnother investor called for changes to dividends in place of share buybacks, which he claimed had done little to support retail shareholder confidence in the bank.\n\"It's disgusting to see Barclays struggling to break 3 (pounds)\", the investor said.\nBarclays shares have risen nearly 11% this year to 296 pence, recovering to their level before U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on April 2 hit bank stocks worldwide.\nHiggins said he believed the majority of retail investors were more bullish about the lender's prospects, and the executive team was committed to improving the share price.\nThe bank plans to return at least 10 billion pounds of capital to shareholders between 2024 and 2026, through dividends and share buybacks, with a continued preference for buybacks.\nOne investor pressed management on how the bank planned to \"insulate\" itself in the U.S. while Trump was in office, particularly in view of the unpredictable outlook and relations with Russia.\n\"We look at the totality of the opportunity and [to manage] the risks there as anywhere else in the world,\" Venkat said in response."
