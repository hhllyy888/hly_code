But the results included a hit from a large single-loan writedown and provisions for the possible impact of tariffs on clients.\nBritain's Barclays (BARC.L), opens new tab on Wednesday also highlighted intense financial market activity as a driver of higher investment banking income. At UBS (UBSG.S), opens new tab, trading revenue increased 32% to $2.5 billion in the three months to end-March.\nSeveral banks surpassed analyst expectations in the first three months of the year but future customer appetite for risk is becoming harder to read.\n\"There was some activity in response to the big market catalyst that we saw at the very beginning of April, but there is more and more uncertainty getting priced in,\" said UBS Chief Financial Officer Todd Tuckner.\nCEO Sergio Ermotti said the economic outlook was \"particularly unpredictable\", with corporate dealmaking on hold, although not yet cancelled.\nAlthough also beating analyst expectations, HSBC (HSBA.L), opens new tab on Tuesday raised the spectre of lower loan demand and an erosion in credit quality due to the broader tariff fallout.\nBarclays CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan struck a similarly sober tone.\n\"...We have to protect ourselves, as we always do with active risk management,\" Venkat told reporters. \"We have long established programmes to transfer and hedge with, and we will continue to do so as warranted by this environment.\"\nWith global trade uncertainty likely to dampen returns from trade finance and lending to multinational corporate customers, some banks are betting on resilient domestic consumer lending businesses to help weather any downturn.\nSpain's Santander (SAN.MC), opens new tab said profit at its retail business, and its corporate and investment banking division, rose 24% and 13% respectively, offsetting weaknesses in Mexico and Brazil.\nIn France, retail banking and equities trading boosted Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), opens new tab. The CEO of BNP Paribas said last week that the bank was preparing to capitalise on opportunities arising from a slowdown such as M&A and restructuring activities as well as Europe's drive to revive economic growth and increase defence spending."
