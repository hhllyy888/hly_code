We see that growth in Sweden is lower,\" he told a news conference.\nThe outlook for the fragile, export-driven Swedish economy has worsened in recent months, driven by fears that tariff wars could weigh on world economic activity.\nThe dimmed outlook has changed the view on monetary policy and several analysts now see the central bank cutting rates at least one more time this year from the current 2.25%.\nHowever, Henriksson said Swedbank had gone through the large and medium-sized companies in its loan portfolio and that the direct impact of the tariffs had been \"quite small\" so far.\nSwedbank had no loan losses in the quarter and instead booked reversals of 141 million crowns due to previously expected loan losses that had not materialised. Analysts had expected loan losses of 309 million crowns in the quarter.\nShares in Swedbank were up 3.6% at 0748 GMT, outperforming the European bank index (.SX7P), opens new tab, which was up 1.3%.\nJP Morgan analysts described the results as \"solid\" in a research note but said that they didn't expect them to lead to any major changes to the outlook for the bank.\nSwedish peer SEB (SEBa.ST), opens new tab reported a first-quarter net profit that was marginally below market expectations on Tuesday as slightly stronger than anticipated interest and commission income was offset by rising credit loss provisions.\n($1 = 9.6170 Swedish crowns)"
