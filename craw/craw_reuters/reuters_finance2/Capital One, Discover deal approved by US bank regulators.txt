Its assets of about $637.8 billion will comprise 2.2% of the nation's insured deposits.\nCapital One and Discover have received all the necessary regulatory approvals for the deal, which will close on May 18, the companies said in a joint statement.\nCapital One will become one of the biggest payment-processing networks in the country, competing against Visa (V.N), opens new tab and Mastercard (MA.N), opens new tab.\nThe combination \"will increase competition in payment networks, offer a wider range of products to our customers, increase our resources devoted to innovation and security, and bring meaningful community benefits,\" said Michael Shepherd, interim CEO and president of Discover.\nBetter Markets, an advocacy group, was critical of the tie-up. The combination will reduce competition, provide less consumer choice and lead to higher fees and costs for consumers, said Shayna Olesiuk, director of banking policy at Better Markets, which was founded after the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe combined U.S. credit card firm would compete with JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), opens new tab, Citigroup (C.N), opens new tab and others.\nThe OCC's approval is conditioned on plans for corrective actions to address the root causes of any outstanding enforcement actions against Discover, the regulator said.\nThe Fed also imposed a regulatory punishment known as a consent order on Discover alongside a fine of $100 million for overcharging fees from 2007 to 2023.\nAnother banking regulator, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, separately said it was ordering Discover to pay a $150 million civil fine for overcharging fees.\nThe Justice Department previously concluded there were no competition concerns compelling enough to block the deal, according to news reports."
