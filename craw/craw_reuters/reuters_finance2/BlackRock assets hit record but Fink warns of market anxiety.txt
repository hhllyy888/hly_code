BlackRock stayed in front of our clients and made some of our greatest leaps forward,\" he said, referring to the global financial crisis and the pandemic.\nFink said in conversations with clients more questions were being asked about reallocations to Europe as U.S. markets experience high volatility and European countries look to boost economic growth through higher government spending.\nBut he added: \"Are we going to see a systematic reallocation into other parts of the world? We have not seen that yet.\"\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index fell 4.6% in the first quarter of 2025, its worst start to a year since 2022.\nA sharp selloff in U.S. government bonds, sparked by tariff tensions, rattled markets this week, triggering dislocations as hedge funds unwound leveraged bets and investors fretted over potential long-term damage to U.S. financial stability.\nFink said the market weakness was damaging not just for Wall Street but for retirement savings of ordinary people too.\nHowever, he did not see systemic risks. \"The markets have proved to be quite successful and work quite well,\" he said.\nBlackRock's net income declined to $1.51 billion, or $9.64 per share, in the three months ended March 31, from $1.57 billion, or $10.48 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted for items such as acquisition-related costs, earnings per share were $11.30, up 15% year on year.\nTotal expenses in the quarter rose to $3.58 billion from $3.04 billion last year.\nBlackRock saw long-term net inflows of $83 billion, up from $76 billion a year ago. A large part of the long-term inflows was captured by fixed income products, at $37.7 billion, down from $41.7 billion a year ago.\nEquity product inflows in the first quarter stood at $19.3 billion, up from $18.4 billion a year earlier.\n\"BlackRock is among the largest providers of bond funds, while also having significant size advantages in equities, alternative assets and cash products,\" Kyle Sanders, financial services analyst for Edward Jones said in a note.\n\"This diversity reduces earnings volatility through the course of market cycles,\" he said.\nBlackRock shares were down 1.1% in early trading. The stock has lost over 10% since Trump announced broad tariffs last week."
