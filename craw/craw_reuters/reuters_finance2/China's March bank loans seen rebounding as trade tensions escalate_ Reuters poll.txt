Total lending would reach 9.14 trillion yuan in the first quarter if the March reading matches forecasts, compared with 9.46 trillion yuan in the same period last year.\nChina has set an ambitious 2025 growth target of \"around 5%\", though analysts believe it may be increasingly difficult to achieve amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions.\nPresident Donald Trump has hiked tariffs on Chinese goods this year to 104%, after China retaliated by matching his \"reciprocal\" duties.\nCiti this week downgraded its China GDP forecast to 4.2% from 4.7% for 2025, warning that higher U.S. tariffs could drag China's growth by at least 1.5 percentage points on an annualised basis.\nIn a sign authorities may step up stimulus to shield the economy from external shocks, the state-run People's Daily said in a commentary last Sunday that China has \"ample room\" for monetary easing, including reserve requirement ratio cuts and interest rate reductions.\nThe paper also flagged the potential for further expansion of fiscal deficits, special bonds and special treasury bonds.\nSeparately, four of China's largest state-owned banks last week unveiled around $72 billion in recapitalisation plans, following through Beijing's pledge to help the lenders increase capital buffers and manage asset quality strains.\nOutstanding yuan loans were expected to rise 7.3% in March from a year earlier, the poll showed, unchanged from the pace in February.\nBroad M2 money supply growth last month was seen at 7.1%, quickening from 7.0% in February.\nTotal social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, likely grew to 4.8 trillion yuan in March from 2.23 trillion yuan in the previous month.\nOutstanding TSF rose 8.2% in February, up from 8.0% in January and December.\n($1 = 7.3495 Chinese yuan)"
