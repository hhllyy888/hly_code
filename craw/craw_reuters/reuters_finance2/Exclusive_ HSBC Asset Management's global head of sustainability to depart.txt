As a result, many financial firms have scaled back their commitment to issues such as tackling climate change.\nLeonard headed HSBC Asset Management's Sustainability Office, which was created in 2021 to manage its sustainable investing efforts and strategy. She also had oversight of its diversity, equity and inclusion-focused initiatives.\nThe responsibilities of that office have now been distributed across other businesses within the asset management division, a spokesperson for the asset manager said.\nOther sustainability-related initiatives have been consolidated under the Responsible Investment team led by Cathrine de Coninck-Lopez, the spokesperson added.\nLeonard was a member of the asset manager's management committee, and it was unclear whether she had also been removed from that position. HSBC declined to comment.\nElhedery has shaken up the bank since assuming the top role six months ago by slashing the ranks of senior managers and reorganising operating divisions and duplicate roles.\nThe bank is on track to deliver $1.5 billion of annual savings by end-2026, equivalent to around 8% of total staff costs.\nHSBC raised the ire of campaigners earlier this year by ditching its target of reaching net-zero emissions across its business by 2030 because of the slow pace of change in the real economy.\nBut the bank told shareholders on Friday it remains committed to its ambition of becoming a net-zero bank by 2050 and has begun a review of its targets for emissions linked to its loans, as well as associated policies.\nThe bank has also hired new executives, including former UK politician Danny Alexander to head up a new unit focused on infrastructure finance and project finance linked to the low-carbon transition.\nIn 2024, HSBC Asset Management managed $179 billion in ESG and sustainable investment strategies and remains a signatory of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, a U.N.-backed group of asset managers working to align investments to net zero."
