We do not believe that is a necessary strategy ... and it is important those VC funds are invested with the interests of the individual pension savers in mind and the trustees have a fiduciary duty to do so,\" Blanc said, after Aviva posted higher first-quarter general insurance premiums.\n\"These are asset classes which are very, very well known to insurance companies. We've got long histories of investing well and delivering really good returns in those segments.\"\nUK pensions minister Torsten Bell has said the accord with pension providers represented a voluntary commitment and there was \"no mandation\".\nHe also rejected the idea that the government could face pressure to compensate schemes if returns disappointed.\nBlackRock CEO (BLK.N), opens new tab Larry Fink earlier this week warned of sustained volatility in financial markets, and said investors were now hoarding tens of trillions of dollars in cash amid trade war worries and uncertainty over the U.S. economy.\nBlanc echoed those concerns and called on savers to engage fully with their pension providers, the majority of which had little to fear from the recent ructions.\n\"We shouldn't get confused about the market volatility that goes on in any particular period of time. We are, as insurers, long term investors. We are not forced sellers. And periods of volatility really do not impact that,\" she said.\n\"What we know is that 12 and a half million people in the UK will not have enough money to retire if we carry on investing in the way that we do today,\" Blanc said, citing official data from the Department of Work and Pensions.\nAccording to the Pensions & Lifetime Savings Association, the current average annual pre-tax retirement income is around 21,000 pounds, comprising around 9,000 pounds in income from a private pension plus state pension of 11,500 pounds.\nThis compares to the PLSA recommended level for a moderate living standard of 31,300 pounds.\n($1 = 0.7533 pounds)"
