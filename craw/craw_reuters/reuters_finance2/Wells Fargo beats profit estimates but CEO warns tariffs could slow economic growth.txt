It booked $149 million of losses on debt securities in the quarter.\nCredit quality held up in the first quarter, allowing the bank to lower provisions. Wells Fargo's provision for credit losses fell to $932 million in the quarter, compared with analysts' expectation of $1.22 billion.\nSantomassimo told reporters customer behavior has been stable.\nOn the corporate and commercial side, many people are pausing investments to gain clarity about tariffs, Santomassimo said.\nOn an adjusted basis, Wells Fargo earned $1.33 per share, beating Wall Street expectations of $1.24, according to estimates compiled by LSEG.\nThe fourth-largest U.S. lender's expenses fell 3% to $13.89 billion in the quarter, compared with estimates of $14.06 billion.\nThe bank has continued to slash its workforce as part of a broader push to save money, while also investing in technology to improve efficiency.\nWells Fargo employed 215,367 people on March 31, compared with 217,502 at the end of 2024. The workforce has fallen every quarter since the third quarter of 2020.\nInvestment banking fees jumped 24% to $775 million from a year earlier, driven by increased activity in debt capital markets.\nWells Fargo is still operating under a $1.95 trillion asset cap that prevents the bank from growing until regulators deem it has fixed problems from a 2016 fake accounts scandal.\nThe asset cap has curtailed Wells Fargo's ability to take in more deposits or expand businesses such as investment banking and trading.\nThe bank has undergone a multi-year effort under Scharf's leadership to fix failings in its governance and risk management.\nProgress on the regulatory front has accelerated this year, with five consent orders closed so far, compared with one in 2024.\n\"We remain confident that we will complete the work needed to close out our other orders,\" Santomassimo said.\nThe bank has closed 11 consent orders since 2019 and still has three open that it is working to address."
