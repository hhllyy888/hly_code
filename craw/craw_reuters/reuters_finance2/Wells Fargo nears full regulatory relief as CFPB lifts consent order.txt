    "content": "April 28 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo (WFC.N), opens new tab cleared its twelfth consent order since 2019 and moved closer to fixing longstanding regulatory issues that have kept the bank under an asset cap of $1.95 trillion.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the top U.S. consumer watchdog, has lifted a 2018 consent order related to the lender's compliance risk management, Wells Fargo said on Monday.\nA similar consent order that the bank had entered into with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, another top regulator, was lifted in February, opens new tab.\n\"Today's termination, along with the recent closure of other consent orders, demonstrates that we have completed much of our common risk and control infrastructure work,\" Wells CEO Charlie Scharf said.\nThe bank's shares rose nearly 1% to $70.29.\nConsent orders are enforcement actions involving a fine or specific directive to address an issue.\nWells Fargo's regulatory issues came under the spotlight after a fake accounts scandal that erupted in 2016, leading to intense scrutiny and billions in fines.\nSince 2018, the bank has also operated under a U.S. Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap, one of the most severe penalties available to regulators, which bars it from growing its balance sheet beyond $1.95 trillion until its problems are fixed.\nThe asset cap could be lifted as soon as the second quarter, given the pace of progress this year and the U.S. administration's push for looser banking regulation, RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy said.\nEfforts to regain compliance have sparked recent optimism among investors. The bank has resolved six consent orders this year, and two are pending.\n\"With both the OCC and the CFPB now apparently comfortable with Wells Fargo's compliance risk management, we view the forward progress as a good sign,\" Piper Sandler analysts said."
