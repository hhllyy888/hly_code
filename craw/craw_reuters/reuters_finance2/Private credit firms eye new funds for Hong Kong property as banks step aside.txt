That loan to a developer for refinancing reaped an internal rate of return (IRR), a key gauge of profitability, of 15%, Chan said.\nThe payoff is higher than the average net IRR of 11.9% recorded by private credit and direct lending funds over the 2018 to 2023 years, considered a solid performance, according to a S&P Global report last year.\nGaw Capital, a Hong Kong-based real estate private equity fund that has $34.4 billion assets under management, is launching a new fund targeting commitment of $2 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\nThe fund will invest in both private credit and private equity deals in tier-1 and 2 cities in Asia Pacific, including Hong Kong, said the person, who declined to be named because the information is not yet public.\nGaw declined to comment.\nSun Hung Kai & Co, a local alternative investment company, launched a new business by co-investing in a $100 million residential mortgage portfolio from developers in November, and it will close another portfolio soon.\n\"We've seen both so-called distressed developers and high-quality, low-geared developers approaching us for cashflow or to optimize the usage of balance sheet,\" said Gigi Wong, the firm's managing director.\n\"And there are Hong Kong banks approaching us to sell their secondary loan or problematic loan.\"\nThe private credit interest comes against the backdrop of liquidity problems in major city developer New World Development (0017.HK), opens new tab and its smaller peers, triggering concerns of a potential domino effect across the entire sector.\nSliding property sales and rentals as well as high vacancies and interest rates are eroding landlords' ability to service debt, Moody's said in a report in February, prompting banks to scale back both new financing and refinancing to the sector.\nTotal loans for property development and investment have been declining since 2022, and are down 12.6% year-on-year at the end of 2024, according to the data compiled by the city's de-facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\"When you have a loan coming due, in today's market, it's very, very hard to get that refinancing done,\" said Edwin Wong, partner and head of Asia Credit at Ares Management, a private credit firm.\n\"We may look at the group level and say, hey, this is something we can think about - to give them that breathing room to ride out the current environment.\" The firm is looking at all debt opportunities, from senior to junior.\nCommercial property has been the worst affected in Hong Kong with record vacancy rates of close to 20%, hurt by an oversupply and grim economic outlook, and prices have dropped 40% since the 2019 peak, according to CBRE data.\nSome distressed commercial properties were transacted last year at 60% lower than peak prices.\nCBRE estimated the funding gap - driven by changes in capital values due to repricing and rental adjustments - in Hong Kong between 2025 and 2027 to be $720 million across the office, industrial and retail sectors.\nBesides asset managers and investment firms, family offices and wealthy individuals are entering the private credit market, attracted by higher yields compared to direct investment in the real estate market, law firm JSM partner Jasmine Chiu said.\nDue to growing competition, interest rates for private credit have come down to the high single and low double digit ranges, from mid-high teens in 2023.\nHowever, some firms are not rushing into deals, said market participants, as they are wary of gaps in valuation expectations and the risks involved.\nRaffles Family Office's head of investment advisory Sky Kwah said investors should exercise more caution when they structure deals, to look for lower loan-to-values (LTVs), tighter covenants and more equity cushion.\nOtherwise, Kwah said, the private credit firms could take a hit if the property market faces further corrections.\nBecause of the growing competition among private credit funds, \"some lenders may be forced to accept looser covenants or lower quality collateral to deploy the capital,\" he said, adding borrowers with weaker fundamentals may pose risks."
