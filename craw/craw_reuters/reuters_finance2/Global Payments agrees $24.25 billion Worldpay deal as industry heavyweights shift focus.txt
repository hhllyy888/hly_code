The pro forma company would be a market leader globally due to the capabilities of its combined products and the scale of its offering to customers, he added.\nThe deal will allow Global Payments to combine Worldpay's strength in online and enterprise transactions with its expertise in serving small and mid-sized companies.\nThe combined company will serve over six million customers and process about 94 billion transactions across more than 175 countries, generating about $12.5 billion in adjusted net revenue and $6.5 billion in adjusted core earnings, per a statement.\nThe Atlanta-based company has been undertaking a review of its business in recent months, shedding smaller pieces to streamline its offering and boost returns. The Worldpay deal is its most comprehensive action since acquiring TSYS for more than $21 billion in 2019.\n\"After several years of uninspiring merchant organic revenue growth and what we consider a lack of strategic cohesiveness, this transaction is a bold step for Global management â€” and long overdue,\" William Blair analyst Andrew Jeffrey said in a note.\nThe deal talks kicked off several months ago when the CEOs of Global Payments, FIS, and Worldpay - Bready, Stephanie Ferris and Charles Drucker - started discussing how a potential transaction might be structured to benefit each other, according to people familiar with the matter.\nUnder the agreement, Global Payments will sell FIS its issuer solutions business for a cash payment and FIS's 45% stake in Worldpay. Global will use the issuer solutions proceeds, as well as other cash and stock to acquire GTCR's Worldpay holding.\nThe private equity firm will own 15% of Global Payments, following the close of the transactions, expected in the first quarter of 2026.\nThe agreements also dramatically reshape FIS, both in shifting its focus to doing business with financial institutions but also shedding its remaining stake in Worldpay, which it acquired for $43 billion in 2019.\n\"We're turning a non cash flow generating minority interest into a strategic asset with an attractive growth profile,\" said FIS Chief Executive Ferris in an interview.\nFerris said the ability to combine its existing debit processing business with Global's issuer solutions unit, which has a strong credit processing offering, would create substantial cross-selling opportunities.\nFIS forecasts more than $500 million of additional adjusted free cash flow generated in the first year after closing, per its statement.\n\"For FIS, there are benefits beyond the asset synergies as it ultimately simplifies the financial profile/perception story for investors,\" said analysts at TD Cowen in a note.\nBy focusing on a single aspect of payments, both companies are aiming to become specialists in one business line, but also address investor concerns about their competitiveness against newer entrants promising better and cheaper payments services.\nBoth have struggled in recent years to deliver share price growth: FIS shares have lost more than half their value since buying Worldpay in 2019.\nWhile the shares of both companies have trailed the S&P 500 index, Global Payments' stock has significantly underperformed rival FIS over the past year.\nShares of Global Payments, which has a market value of about $17 billion, closed down 17.4% on Thursday, while FIS, also known as Fidelity National Information Services, jumped 8.7%.\nThe announcement for the deal was complicated by the wider market volatility, which delayed the signing of an agreement by a few days, according to sources.\nGoldman Sachs advised FIS, Wells Fargo advised Worldpay, and Morgan Stanley served as financial advisor to GTCR."
