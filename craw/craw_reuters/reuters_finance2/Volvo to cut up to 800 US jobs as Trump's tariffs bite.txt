His vacillating trade policy has undermined consumer and business confidence, and caused economists to raise their forecasts for a U.S. recession.\nVolvo Group's lay-offs are the latest response from a car and truck industry that is reeling from the Republican president's tariffs on certain parts, which is expected to increase the cost of manufacturing vehicles.\n\"Heavy-duty truck orders continue to be negatively affected by market uncertainty about freight rates and demand, possible regulatory changes, and the impact of tariffs,\" a spokesperson for Volvo Group North America said in an emailed statement.\n\"We regret having to take this action, but we need to align production with reduced demand for our vehicles.\""
