UniCredit will be taking time to assess the viability and impact of the prescriptions,\" it said.\nUniCredit plans to launch on April 28 its 14 billion-euro ($16 billion) all-share bid for BPM, which is one of many hostile takeover bids rocking Italian banking.\nThe government of conservative Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni vetted the BPM deal using special 'golden powers' that allow it to block or set conditions on foreign and domestic takeovers in sectors such as energy, telecommunications and banking.\nThe scope of such rules in Italy for banking deals is under scrutiny by the European Commission.\nThe government said in a statement it was protecting strategic interests for national security in setting the prescriptions.\nForeign Minister Antonio Tajani campaigned against imposing them because it could expose the government to legal risks, one source with knowledge of the matter said, signalling a split in the government.\nOther demands are likely to focus on bank branches to ensure services to customers and indirectly preserve jobs should the takeover be finalised, a second source said.\nUniCredit is among only a handful of international banks that failed to leave Russia after the Ukraine war broke out in 2022, with Orcel saying he refused to damage shareholders by foregoing a fair price for the assets.\nThe bank has accelerated the reduction of its Russian exposure to meet ECB demands.\nIn an indirect reference to Orcel on Thursday, Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said bankers were rightly concerned with profits, but ministers had to act in the general interest.\nBy swooping on Banco BPM in November, Orcel derailed the government's plans to promote a tie-up between BPM and state-backed Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), opens new tab. MPS has since launched an offer for Mediobanca MDBI.MI.\nUniCredit has the right to drop the BPM acquisition because Banco has raised the price of its own bid for fund manager Anima Holding (ANIM.MI), opens new tab and clinched the purchase despite being denied favourable regulatory capital treatment.\nUniCredit plans to wait until the very end, possibly as late as June 30, just before the payment date, to decide what to do.\nBefore the latest bid, UniCredit had twice been close to moving on Banco BPM since Orcel took over in 2021, but he decided against the deal. Bankers do not rule out he could walk away a third time.\nOrcel has also built stakes in insurer Generali (GASI.MI), opens new tab and in German rival Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), opens new tab, saying these are only financial investments, though he has called for a merger with Commerzbank.\nA shareholder vote on April 24 at Generali to pick the CEO amid a boardroom battle could shed some light on Orcel's strategy in relation to the insurer.\n($1 = 0.8780 euros)"
