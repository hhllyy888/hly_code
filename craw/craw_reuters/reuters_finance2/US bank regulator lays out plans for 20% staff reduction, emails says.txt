The goal is to reduce staffing by about 1,250 people, according to a copy of the email seen by Reuters.\nThe agency was authorized for nearly 6,900 employees in 2025, according to its most recent annual report.\nThe effort mirrors similar moves at other government agencies, as President Donald Trump, alongside billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, move to drastically shrink the size of the federal government.\nThe FDIC has already seen hundreds of employees agree to resign as part of a government-wide buyout offer, and the agency will offer subsequent opportunities for staff to agree to retire early or take incentives to resign.\nHowever, the email states that the FDIC may reject offers to exit from some employees, including for workers who examine and help resolve failed banks or keep sensitive bank information safe.\nThe agency would pursue wider involuntary layoffs if necessary sometime after May 13, according to the email."
