AUD/USD trading volume has been flat for four years while volume in nearly every other major pair has been trending higher.\n\"We get interest from clients on cross-market type trades, when they would prefer to invest in Australia as opposed to taking risk in China,\" said Mark Elworthy, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities trading at Bank of America in Australia.\n\"People are probably not looking for as big a move as they used to, so they're well aware of the change in correlation...so some of the positions are larger than we would normally expect.\"\nAccording to Westpac's research, the correlation between U.S. stocks and the Aussie dollar has fallen from above 0.6 in 2022 to below 0.4.\nThe Aussie's relationship with global risk across equities, commodities, credit and currency markets has been slowly falling since about 2013, Westpac found, which coincided with the beginning of a vast expansion in Australia's offshore assets.\nAustralia's net foreign equity position hit a record A$656 billion ($412.76 billion) at the end of last year, up from around zero a decade earlier and tripling since 2022, Westpac said.\nThe behaviour of a position of that scale in a major crisis is untested, but a possibility is that money flows back to Australia and puts upward pressure on the currency.\nAt the same time, commodity exporters' currencies are also decoupling from commodity markets, according to Huw McKay, former chief economist at BHP and now visiting fellow at the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University in Canberra.\nHe modelled the Australian dollar against the country's terms of trade - the ratio of export to import prices - adjusted for inflation and interest rates, and found between 1996 and 2019 the Aussie had a correlation of above 0.8, under the model, and that it fell below 0.6 in the period between 2016 and 2023.\nHe is not sure if it is a permanent shift, an aberration, or something in between. But in dealing rooms, traders are not waiting to find out.\n\"You used to see a headline: 'Tariffs come out' and you hit Aussie, or: 'Trump's pulled back on his tariffs,' and you buy,\" said ATFX's Twidale.\n\"Now (traders) are saying it's just not worth doing.\"\n($1 = 1.5893 Australian dollars)"
