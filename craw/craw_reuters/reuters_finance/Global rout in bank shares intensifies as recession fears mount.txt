Citigroup (C.N), opens new tab and Bank of America (BAC.N), opens new tab were the biggest losers in the index, both dropping more than 7.5%.\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), opens new tab, the largest U.S. lender, lost 6.5%, while Goldman Sachs (GS.N), opens new tab and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), opens new tab fell 7.1% and 6.8%, respectively.\nThe selloff accelerated after China's finance ministry said on Friday it would impose additional tariffs of 34% on all U.S. goods from April 10 in retaliation for Trump's move.\nBanks, which serve as bellwethers for economic activity, saw their shares sink as the U.S. breaks with free trade policies built up over decades. Investors braced for declines in consumer spending, loan demand and dealmaking.\n\"Bank stock valuations tell us investors are leaning toward the bear case for banks becoming a reality,\" according to brokerage Raymond James, which pointed to investor expectations for a recession in 2025.\nThe near-term pain for banks could prompt them to scale back earnings projections given tariffs were more severe than expected, said Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo.\n\"Banks will need to potentially increase reserve for future loan loss provisions,\" which will weigh on profits, he said.\nCitigroup (C.N), opens new tab was among the largest decliners, falling more than 10.5% today before paring losses to about 8%. On Thursday, it lost 11%.\n\"Citi has been undergoing a restructuring exercise for the last two years, and the expectation was that the profitability would go up,\" said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas.\n\"That has been disappointing so far, but the stock got a lot of headway... and now that investors are seeing some stress in the market, the inflated stocks are correcting more,\" he said.\nThe tremors were felt across regions. European banking stocks (.SX7P), opens new tab tumbled 8% and the financials sector was the biggest drag on the STOXX Europe 600 (.STOXX), opens new tab.\nIn Asia, Japanese megabanks ended the week with the biggest losses since the 2008 financial crisis, an unsettling signal about the consequences of Trump's trade war that rattled investors.\nA universal 10% tariff on U.S. imports is set to take effect on April 5, followed by further levies on dozens of countries.\nMounting fears of retaliation, which Trump officials have warned could escalate the dispute further, have led some to shorten their odds on a recession coming to pass.\n\"Banks are in a precarious situation,\" said Anthony Georgiades, founder at investment firm Innovating Capital. \"They are going to have a crazy margin compression and credit risk will increase, especially in auto and consumer loans.\"\nThe drop in shares is a sharp reversal for the sector, which a few months ago was riding high on post-election optimism. While the tariffs don't hit banks directly, they may prompt companies to pause M&A plans and erode consumer sentiment, which can ultimately hit investment banking fees and slow loan demand.\nU.S. banking giants will be quizzed about the turmoil when they begin to report earnings next week, with JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo (WFC.N), opens new tab and BNY (BK.N), opens new tab set to announce their results on Friday.\nIn Europe, shares of Germany's Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), opens new tab 9%, and Italy's UniCredit (CRDI.MI), opens new tab tumbled 10.1%. France's Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), opens new tab lost 10.3%.\nJapanese bank stocks logged their biggest weekly loss in at least 40 years, while investors sought safety in government bonds.\n\"The world has changed, and in few economies do these changes reverberate as strongly as in Japan,\" said Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC in Hong Kong.\nShares in Japan's biggest bank by market value, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T), opens new tab, fell 8.5% on Friday for a weekly loss of 20% - the largest since 2003.\nMizuho Financial Group (8411.T), opens new tab was down more than 22% for the week, the largest drop since 2008, while shares in Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T), opens new tab were 20% lower for the week.\n\"It's a wholesale move out of banking stocks and I think this will continue,\" said Amir Anvarzadeh, Japan equity strategist at Asymmetric Investors.\nJapan's TOPIX banks index (.IBNKS.T), opens new tab is down 24% from a 19-year high it touched only two weeks ago. Its weekly drop of 20.2% is the biggest in LSEG data stretching back to 1983."
