    "content": " article summary \nSantander's 62% stake in Polish unit worth 7.3 bln euros\nVolatility has triggered sharp sell-off in banking shares\nShares in Santander up 5%, in Polish unit up 6.5%\nApril 8 (Reuters) - Spain's Santander (SAN.MC), opens new tab is exploring options for its roughly $8 billion (7.3 billion euro) majority stake in its Polish unit, including a potential sale, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\nSantander shares closed up around 5% as other European banking stocks recovered from recent drops. Meanwhile, shares of the Polish unit, Santander Bank Polska (SPL1.WA), opens new tab, rose 6.5% after the Bloomberg report.\nThe Spanish bank declined to comment on the report.\nOne person familiar with the bank said divesting the whole stake or cutting it to just a majority could make sense, as the unit did not offer cross-business opportunities with other countries. The person was not aware of any plan to do so.\nThe lender owns a 62.2% stake in Santander Bank Polska after selling a 5.2% stake for 575 million euros in September.\nA potential divestment in Poland would come at a moment when Santander, the euro zone's biggest lender by market value, is expanding its footprint in the U.S. in areas such as corporate and investment banking and its digital Openbank.\nAt the same time, it is reviewing its British presence as part of a regular assessment of its major markets, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters in January.\nBloomberg said in its report that deliberations over the Polish unit were preliminary and Santander could decide to keep the asset for longer or opt for a partial selldown of its stake.\nSantander in Poland was trading at 1.53 times its book value on Tuesday, down from 1.8 times before the market sell-off linked to the announcement of tariffs in the U.S.\nAt its Polish unit, net profit in the fourth quarter rose 9% to 158 million euros thanks to a rise in lending income which offset rising costs related to foreign currency mortgage loans.\nIn 2024, net profit in this market rose 18.8% to 800 million euros, representing 5.8% of the whole group's profit.\n(1 euro = $1.0910)"
