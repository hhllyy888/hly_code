A prime brokerage desk lends money to hedge funds for trading and tracks their activities.\nHedge funds have reduced their net exposure across all regions, especially in Europe, followed by emerging markets and Asia.\nThe amount traded on transparent and non-transparent stock exchanges trended lower in March, shows data from BMLL Technologies, bar a large options expiry on March 21. Such dates often see larger volumes traded as the derivatives that trade off their prices are closed.\nHedge funds have sold out of major emerging markets.\nAnd so far this year, they have maintained more short than long positions in emerging market stocks in Latin America and Asia.\nIn Asia, stocks have been particularly sold in large amounts in March, Goldman Sachs data showed. A short position expects an asset price to decline, a long bet hopes it will rise.\nHedge funds have cut their positions in stocks whose performance is closely tied to the economic cycle. These companies, like auto-parts manufacturers, some jewellery brands and home furnishing stores typically struggle when consumers have less money to spend.\nThat move coincides with increased concern that tariffs are raising U.S. recession risks.\nHedge funds have starting selling European auto stocks, having snapped them up until early March, the Goldman data showed.\nSpeculators have piled into short positions on the sector since Trump last week made public a plan to implement a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks from April 3. A duty on auto parts begins on May 3.\nThe ratio of long positions compared to short bets against the auto sector are close to historic lows, said Goldman.\nHedge funds have been net buyers in large amounts in recent weeks of company stocks that are sensitive to metals prices, said Goldman.\nHedge fund holdings in these names are at multi-year highs said the note. The note did not mention company names."
