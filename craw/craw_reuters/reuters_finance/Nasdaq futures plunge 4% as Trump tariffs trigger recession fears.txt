We're going to continue to trade on a heavy tone because of the heightened risk of either recession or stagflation,\" said Elias Haddad, senior markets strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.\n\"We could see the correction bottom out when we have firm evidence that we're not falling into recession.\"\nThe CBOE Volatility index (.VIX), opens new tab, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, touched a three-week high at 26.91 points.\nThe tariffs, poised to disrupt the global trade order and unsettle businesses, highlight a stark shift from just a few months ago when the promise of business-friendly policies under the Trump administration propelled U.S. stocks to record highs.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX), opens new tab and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab fell 10% from their record highs last month, marking a correction, as investors priced in the damage from tariffs on the economy and businesses.\nTraders are ramping up expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at least three times this year, with the possibility of a fourth cut by the year's end becoming less of a long shot.\nThat heightens the significance of Friday's payrolls data and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech, which could offer crucial insights into the health of the U.S. economy and the future path of interest rates.\nData on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell last week, pointing to continued labor market stability ahead of potential volatility from import tariffs.\n\"The prospect of looser monetary policy and potentially greater fiscal stimulus once the Trump administration announces the tax cut plan should provide some support to equity markets,\" Haddad added.\nRetailers were hit hard on Thursday, with Nike (NKE.N), opens new tab dropping 13% and Walmart (WMT.N), opens new tab falling 5.7% after Trump imposed a raft of new tariffs on major production hubs including Vietnam, Indonesia and China.\nBig banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), opens new tab, Citigroup (C.N), opens new tab and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), opens new tab, which are sensitive to economic risks, dropped about 4.5% each.\nFutures tracking the U.S. small-cap Russell 2000 index tumbled 5.1%, underscoring concerns about the health of the domestic economy.\nOil stocks including Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), opens new tab and Chevron fell about 4% each as crude prices , slumped 6% on Trump tariffs and OPEC+ speeding up output hikes."
