We have already improved our internal documentation and control processes, and we continue to do so,\" DWS said.\nIn 2021, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic began investigating accusations, sparked by a whistleblower, that DWS may have misled investors by marketing its funds as greener than they actually were.\nDesiree Fixler, who joined DWS as group sustainability officer in 2020, would later allege to regulators, investigators and journalists that DWS misrepresented how green its investments were. She left the company in 2021.\nIts CEO at the time, Asoka Woehrmann, who has called the allegations relating to his time in office \"unfounded\", later resigned after German prosecutors raided DWS and Deutsche Bank offices in Frankfurt.\nRegulators globally have sought to clamp down on greenwashing by companies in order to improve transparency about the sustainability of investments.\nDWS, which is 80% owned by Deutsche Bank, manages around 1 trillion euros in assets.\n($1 = 0.9261 euros)"
