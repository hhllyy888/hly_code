It also posted a 54% surge in debt underwriting revenue, together lifting investment banking performance by 7%.\n\"Periods of change and uncertainty generally reduce confidence and visibility until we are able to absorb what is happening and form a perspective,\" Friedman said.\n\"Predominantly, people are viewing this as a moment to take stock, not a moment to draw lasting conclusions,\" he said, noting that business executives still saw the Trump administration as pro-business and likely to reduce regulation.\nAmong deals in the quarter, Jefferies was a bookrunner on cybersecurity firm SailPoint's (SAIL.O), opens new tab $1.4 billion U.S. IPO and served as a financial adviser to Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI.O), opens new tab on its $14.6 billion acquisition by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), opens new tab.\nLarger rivals Morgan Stanley (MS.N), opens new tab, Goldman Sachs (GS.N), opens new tab and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), opens new tab are set to report earnings next month, offering a broader view of Wall Street's dealmaking recovery.\nWhile some Wall Street banks have already started cutting jobs, Jefferies' staffing is likely to stay stable after it went on a hiring spree in recent years.\nJefferies reported a profit of 57 cents per share in the three months ended February 28. Analysts on average had expected 94 cents per share, according to estimates compiled by LSEG."
