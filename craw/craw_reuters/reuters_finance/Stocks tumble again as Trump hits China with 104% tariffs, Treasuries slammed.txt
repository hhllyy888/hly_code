That deadline passed with no new developments on trade.\n\"U.S. and China are stuck in an unprecedented, and expensive, game of chicken, and it seems that both sides are unwilling to back down,\" said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura.\nThe shifting headlines on tariffs and the spectre of a prolonged trade war between the world's two biggest economies has generated severe volatility across financial markets.\nThe S&P 500 was swept up in one of the biggest reversals in at least the last 50 years, with the benchmark index losing 4.2 percentage points from a positive start to a negative finish. The index has lost $5.8 trillion in stock market value, the deepest four-day loss since it was created in the 1950s.\nThe VIX index of equity volatility has shot to 60 this week, its highest since August.\nIn Europe, the STOXX 600 (.STOXX), opens new tab fell nearly 3% in early trading, bringing the loss in market capitalisation since April 1 - the day before Trump unveiled his tariffs - to around $1.4 trillion.\nU.S. stock futures were anchored in negative territory, down 0.3% on the day , .\nLate on Tuesday, Trump said China was manipulating its currency to protect against tariffs, but he thought China would make a deal at some point.\nAnalysts at JPMorgan believed the rapid escalation with U.S. tariffs on China were disruptive enough to push the global economy into recession.\n\"Given the import bill from China, the China tariff alone amounts to a whopping $400bn tax hike on U.S. households and businesses,\" they said in a note to clients. \"The currency is likely to be a release valve for China policymakers.\"\nSafe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc found some more love, with the dollar skidding 0.9% to 145 yen and down 0.5% to 0.843 Swiss franc .\nOil prices fell as much as 4% as concern over the outlook for global energy demand outweighed any nervousness on the geopolitical front. Brent crude futures were last down 2.4% at $61.30 a barrel.\nGold regained its upward momentum and was last up 2% at $3,005 per ounce."
