Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.\"\nJPMorgan's economists raised the risk of a U.S. and global recession this year to 60% from 40% after Trump unveiled the steepest trade barriers in more than 100 years last week. When asked on Sunday about falling markets, Trump said sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\nDimon noted the potential for retaliation by other countries and said tariffs could affect economic confidence, investments, capital flows, corporate profits and the dollar.\n\"The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,\" the CEO wrote.\nDimon often weighs in on government policies, and has been consulted by officials in times of crisis.\nHis name was floated for senior economic roles in government during the 2024 presidential campaign, including Treasury secretary, but he stayed put at the bank.\nTariffs also raise questions about the direction of interest rates, Dimon said. While rates have declined recently because of the weaker dollar, the prospect of slower growth and declining risk appetite could cause rates to rise, he said, referring to the stagflation of the 1970s.\nExpectations for modest U.S. growth, known as a soft landing, could also be derailed.\n\"We enter this time of uncertainty with high equity and debt prices, even after the recent decline ... markets still seem to be pricing assets with the assumption that we will continue to have a fairly soft landing. I am not so sure,\" Dimon wrote."
