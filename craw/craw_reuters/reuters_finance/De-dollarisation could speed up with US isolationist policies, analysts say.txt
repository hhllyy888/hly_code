The dollar is the dominant currency for economic trade and capital flows.\n\"The bar for withdrawing support at a time of systemic financial stress would seem exceptionally high,\" analysts George Saravelos and Oliver Harvey said in a note to clients on Thursday, assessing possible scenarios and citing the Reuters article.\nWithout the Fed backstops, in the short term, \"the dollar liquidity scramble would drive dollar funding costs higher, leading to a sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar.\"\nBut financial stress would spread to the U.S. financial system as well, they added, and spillover effects could include \"a fire sale of U.S. assets.\"\nWhile the Fed is independent, \"the U.S. administration can have an indirect influence both via moral suasion as well as the appointment of the Fed governing board\", the analysts said.\n\"The U.S. could in theory use the availability of its swap lines in a selective manner, as a quid pro quo for other policy goals.\"\nFor Jane Foley, Rabobank's head of forex strategy, the questioning by some European central banking and supervisory officials of the Fed's dollar support shows the \"sea-change\" in ties between the U.S. and European allies over the past few months and \"the sphere of the disruptive influences of the U.S. President.\"\n\"Trump's trade and foreign policies have forced Europe on a path towards reduced reliance on the U.S. and this is likely to imply a desire for reduced reliance on the dollar,\" Foley said in a note.\n\"Trump threatened countries that tried to de-dollarise with extra tariffs. Ironically, his isolationist policies may drive the trend.\"\nDeutsche Bank analysts also said a withdrawal of the Fed's swap lines \"has the capacity to create enormous financial instability at times of stress.\"\n\"If such a withdrawal became a concern it would likely create pressure for the rest of the world to de-dollarize more rapidly,\" they added."
