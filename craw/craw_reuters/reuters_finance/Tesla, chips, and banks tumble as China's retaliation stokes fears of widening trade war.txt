    "content": " article summary \nChina imposes 34% tariffs on US goods\nTesla down 8%; machinery also among losers\nGE Healthcare falls on anti-dumping probe, export controls\nApril 4 (Reuters) - U.S. chip companies, banks and oil majors fell sharply on Friday after China retaliated to Trump's tariffs with steep duties, in an intensifying trade war between the world's two largest economies that cast a shadow on global growth.\nChina slapped additional duties of 34% on U.S. goods, set to go into effect April 10. It also announced curbs on exports of some rare-earths and added several U.S. firms to its export control list and the \"unreliable entities\" list, which allows Beijing to take punitive action.\nThe action followed U.S. President Donald Trump's 34% duties on imports from China announced on Wednesday, which triggered a massive market meltdown on Thursday. The latest levies were on top of the 20% tariffs on China imposed earlier this year.\nInvestors were already fretting over potential supply chain disruptions, price hikes and demand destruction for everything from cars and smartphones to sneakers.\nShares of Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab and Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab - among consumer tech companies with a large exposure to China - were down 8% and 4%, respectively. While both companies have local production in China, duties on U.S.-imported parts could squeeze margins and force price hikes.\n\"Several tech companies have established local supply chains in China. Most source components from China already, and hence, disruptions should be controllable, though we do expect price hikes on parts and components not being sourced from China,\" said Nishant Udupa, practice director at research firm Everest Group.\nFor Tesla, already in a bruising price war with local Chinese rivals, raising prices would pressure demand further.\n\"Apple's smartphone sales had already been declining in China for some time, faced with growing, cheaper competition. So, the prospect of steep import duties being imposed is likely to sharply erode sales even further,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.\nShares of Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab, Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab were subdued as they had limited exposure to China.\nGE Healthcare's (GEHC.O), opens new tab stock slid nearly 13%, following China's export controls on a rare-earth metal that is used in MRI scans. The country's announcement of an anti-dumping investigation into imports of certain medical CT tubes from the U.S. and India added to the worries.\nChip companies are set to face headwinds, too, although U.S. exports a much smaller amount of electronic equipment to China. Shares of Intel (INTC.O), opens new tab, Applied Materials (AMAT.O), opens new tab and Qualcomm (QCOM.O), opens new tab, all of which count on China for at least 30% of revenue, were down 5% to 8%.\nThe U.S. exported more than $15 billion worth of electrical and electronic equipment to China in 2024, with most of the value coming from integrated circuits, transistors and other semiconductor devices, according to economic data provider Trading Economics. In comparison, the U.S. imported more than $127 billion in electronic equipment from China last year.\n\"Semiconductors will feel a greater impact ... We're already witnessing a domestic ecosystem evolve in China, with direct alternatives for every major US semiconductor firm. This trend is likely to accelerate,\" Udupa said.\nCrude prices, already under pressure from an expected OPEC+ oil output hike in May, added to the losses.\nOil majors Exxon (XOM.N), opens new tab and Chevron (CVX.N), opens new tab fell more than 5%. Top oilfield service company SLB (SLB.N), opens new tab dropped 10%, and the biggest U.S. refiner by volume, Marathon Petroleum, (MPC.N), opens new tab fell 6%. Chemicals company DuPont (DD.N), opens new tab slid 12%.\n\"The trade war escalated, recession fears rise and consequently oil demand growth is to take a sizeable hit,\" said Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM.\nChina is also the largest market for U.S. agricultural products, even as imports of U.S. farm goods dropped last year.\nShares of top grain traders like Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM.N), opens new tab fell 8% while Bunge (BG.N), opens new tab was down 6%. Fertilizer firms Mosaic (MOS.N), opens new tab and CF Industries (CF.N), opens new tab fell 10% and 8%, respectively.\nChina's tariffs on U.S. soybean exports would increase the cost to local customers, especially animal feed producers, and could prompt the country to source more from Brazil and Argentina, said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.\nBanks' shares extended their declines from Thursday. The industry has been clouded by fears that a trade dispute could temper consumer confidence, reduce spending, weaken loan demand and pressure fees from advising on deals.\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), opens new tab, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, sank 7%. Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs (GS.N), opens new tab and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), opens new tab dropped more than 7% each.\nHeavy machinery makers Caterpillar (CAT.N), opens new tab and Deere (DE.N), opens new tab fell 5% and 4%, respectively, on concerns over demand from one of their largest overseas markets.\nChina is a major buyer of construction and agricultural equipment and a key player in global infrastructure spending.\nShares of major luxury and footwear firms reversed coursed after Trump said Vietnam's leader To Lam has offered to reduce tariffs on U.S. imports. Ralph Lauren's shares were up 2.5%, while Tapestry rose as much as 3.6%.\nNike gained 4%, Roger Federer-backed On jumped 7.2% and Lululemon Athletica rose 3%. The stocks had initially fallen after retaliatory tariffs by China, a major revenue contributor."
