If we want to grow America's electricity production meaningfully over the next five or 10 years, we've got to stop closing coal plants,\" Wright said in the interview.\nAsked about Trump's comment that the European Union should buy more energy from the United States, Wright said he has had countries in Asia, in Europe and elsewhere reach out to express interest in buying more American energy.\"\nWright said he does not think European countries will want to return to Russia for their energy supplies when the war in Ukraine ends.\n\"As I talk to European leaders, one thing they all share is a regret that they bet their energy future on Russia,\" he said. \"So I don't think there's a huge desire right now that, when the war is over, we're going to we're going to re-count on Russia for a dominant share of our energy supply. I think that's very unlikely to unfold.\""
