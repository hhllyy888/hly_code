    "content": "BERLIN, April 7 (Reuters) - Investor morale in the euro zone tumbled in April to its lowest point in more than a year, a survey showed on Monday, as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs hammered sentiment in the bloc.\nThe Sentix index for the euro zone fell to -19.5 in April from -2.9 in March, its lowest level since October 2023 and below the -10.0 forecast by analysts polled by Reuters.\nThe 27-nation bloc faces 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars and \"reciprocal\" tariffs of 20% from Wednesday for almost all other goods under Trump's measures.\nThe survey of 1,127 investors from April 3-5 showed that economic expectations for the next six months were hit particularly hard by the tariff announcement, falling by 33.8 points to -15.8 in April.\nThat is the second sharpest fall in the history of Sentix data since 2002, topped only by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nThe current situation index recorded only a slight fall, to -23.3 in April from -21.8.\nExpectations for Germany, Europe's largest economy, recorded an even stronger fall, dipping by 36.3 points to -15.8 in April.\n\"Hopes following the planned debt orgy have been buried,\" said Sentix in a statement, referring to debt-financed investments planned by the newly forming German government aimed at bumping up defence and infrastructure."
