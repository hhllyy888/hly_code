Meanwhile, Credit Agricole said the European Central Bank had cleared its 19.8% stake in Banco BPM.\nThe French bank has key commercial interests to protect in Italy, its biggest foreign market, where multi-year commercial deals bring in fees.\nWhen announcing the Banco BPM bid, UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel invited BPM's investors to talks, saying solutions of mutual satisfaction could be worked out. However, buyout regulation requires equal treatment for all shareholders.\nOrcel has bargaining power in a distribution deal between UniCredit and Credit Agricole's fund manager Amundi (AMUN.PA), opens new tab, which ends in 2027.\nOrcel, who has been rebuilding in-house fund skills, has not ruled out ending rather than renewing the deal which was signed when Amundi bought UniCredit's fund business for 3.6 billion euros.\nCredit Agricole also has consumer finance and non-life insurance partnerships with Banco BPM which it is keen to keep going.\nCredit Agricole became Banco BPM's main investor in 2022, acquiring 9.2% shortly after an earlier failed takeover plan by UniCredit.\nThe French bank has managed to keep Italy's government on side, with a non-aggressive expansion strategy, and stepping in to buy failing lenders in 2017.\nOrcel's swoop on BPM in November instead upended the Italian Treasury's plans to promote an eventual tie-up between Banco BPM and state-backed Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), opens new tab.\nButtressing BPM's defences against UniCredit, Credit Agricole bought derivatives in December to raise its holding after an informal nod from the Rome government. It bought further derivatives in the first quarter, it said, reiterating that it won't bid for the whole of BPM.\nUniCredit has said its BPM bid is \"autonomous and independent\" of its ambition to tie up with Germany's Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), opens new tab.\nOrcel has bought 28% of Commerzbank and wants to discuss a potential acquisition with Berlin's new government, though he has pushed back any deal to 2026 or even 2027.\nOrcel also has 4.2% of Italian insurer Generali (GASI.MI), opens new tab and could weigh in at an April 24 shareholder vote to elect a new board, before the finalisation of a landmark asset management deal.\nWith interest rates declining, asset management has become crucial for bank revenues. Just before UniCredit's offer, Banco BPM had bid for Italian asset manager Anima Holding (ANIM.MI), opens new tab.\nTo secure that deal, Banco BPM got shareholder approval to raise the price and proceed even without capital benefits which the ECB could have granted.\nThese decisions give UniCredit the right to drop the BPM bid. UniCredit said it has until 0529 GMT on June 30 to decide whether to pay more for BPM, or waive the conditions linked to Anima.\nAfter the loss of the capital benefits, which has weighed on BPM shares, the discount of UniCredit's offer to Banco BPM's market value has halved to 500 million euros.\n($1 = 0.9260 euros)"
