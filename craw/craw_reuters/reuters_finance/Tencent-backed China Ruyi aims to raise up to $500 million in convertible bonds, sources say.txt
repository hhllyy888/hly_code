    "content": "HONG KONG, April 3 (Reuters) - Streaming media firm China Ruyi Holdings (0136.HK), opens new tab, backed by gaming and internet company Tencent (0700.HK), opens new tab, is aiming to raise between $300 million and $500 million in convertible bonds next week, two sources with knowledge of the plan said.\nThe offering of Hong Kong-listed Ruyi could be launched as early as Monday, said one of the sources.\nThe bulk of the proceeds to be raised could be used for a potential acquisition, the sources said.\nDiscussions around the acquisition, however, are at early stages and may not be fruitful, said the sources, who declined to be named as the information was confidential.\nRuyi has tapped Bank of America, CLSA, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Macquarie to work on the convertible bond offering, said one of the sources.\nRuyi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCLSA, Goldman, Deutsche Bank and Macquarie declined to comment. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nRuyi's fundraising comes as Chinese firms are accelerating offshore equity fundraising efforts, tapping into a rebound in investor sentiment fueled by hopes of Beijing's support for private firms.\nThe fundraising momentum, however, could get clouded by U.S. President Donald Trump's new tariffs announced on Wednesday, a move that has sent shockwaves through markets amid worries the aggressive duties will slow growth and hit corporate earnings.\nChina equity capital markets' fundraising totalled $24 billion in the first quarter, up over 200% from the same period last year, LSEG data showed.\nConvertible bonds offering by Chinese companies increased more than five times year-on-year in the same period to reach a total value of $4.9 billion, the data showed.\nRuyi, which counts Tencent as its second largest shareholder with a 16.4% stake and a major customer, engages in online streaming services, film and television production and distribution business as well as online gaming services.\nIt has produced several hit Chinese series such as \"To the Wonder\" and \"War of Faith\".\nThe company on Monday reported a total revenue of 3.7 billion yuan for 2024, up 1.4% year-on-year. Its adjusted net profit more than doubled to 1.25 billion yuan."
