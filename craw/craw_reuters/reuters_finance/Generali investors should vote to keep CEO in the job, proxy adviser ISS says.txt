One of these was submitted by another major Generali investor who is a longtime Donnet opposer, while the other was submitted by a group of Italian fund managers.\n\"Overall, the company has been performing well in recent years, and supporting the slate of candidates submitted by Mediobanca appears the best option for ensuring strategic and management continuity,\" ISS said.\n\"Supporting alternative slates might entail significant risk of ungovernability and strategic disruption,\" it added in a proxy voting report for investors seen by Reuters."
