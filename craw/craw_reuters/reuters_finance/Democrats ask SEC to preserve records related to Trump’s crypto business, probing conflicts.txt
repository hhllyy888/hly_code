The congressional members’ letter to the SEC does not cite any legal authority that would compel the agency to abide by its requests.\nA White House spokesperson said in an emailed statement that \"President Trump’s assets are in a trust managed by his children. There are no conflicts of interest.\"\nThe House Financial Services Committee, led by Republicans, on Wednesday considered legislation that would regulate the broader adoption of crypto stablecoins. The Trump White House has identified promoting their use as a legislative priority.\nReuters published a story on Monday documenting how, as World Liberty Financial raised more than half a billion dollars in recent months, Trump’s family took control of the crypto venture and grabbed the lion’s share of those funds, aided by governance terms that industry experts say favor insiders.\nOverall, the Trump family now has a claim on 75% of net revenues from token sales of World Liberty, and 60% from operations once the core “decentralized finance” business gets going. The arrangement means the Trump family is currently entitled to about $400 million in fees, Reuters reported.\n“It’s disappointing that Senator Warren is attempting to weaponize the power of the government to continue to harass and target the Trump family and our project,\" a World Liberty Financial spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \"What’s implied in the letter is completely disgusting, false, and dangerous. She has been a vocal and consistent opponent of the crypto industry for years, but Luddites with political vendettas won’t stop us from building and deploying a world-class platform that can benefit millions.”\nPresident Trump's three sons, all of whom were named in the letter, did not respond to direct requests for comment. The same was true for World Liberty co-founders listed in the letter, including a pair of crypto entrepreneurs; Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration’s envoy to the Mideast; and one of Witkoff's sons.\nA spokesperson for the SEC said in a statement to Reuters that, \"Acting Chairman Uyeda will respond to Members of Congress directly.\"\nThe lawmakers’ letter requests that the SEC preserve and provide copies of any records or communications from the White House to the SEC regarding World Liberty, with a list of more than half a dozen Trump family members and their business partners. It asks what procedures might be in place to “prevent the Trump family’s unprecedented financial ties to the crypto industry from influencing or guiding the SEC’s decisions.”\nThe Trump Organization announced in January the president's investments, assets and business interests would be held in a trust managed by his children and he would play no role in day-to-day operations or decision-making. The family's business also retained an attorney to serve as an ethics adviser to \"avoid any perceived conflicts of interest.\"\nAmong the nine items the Democrats are requesting from the SEC are items specific to World Liberty investor Justin Sun and records regarding the SEC’s recent decision to pause its case against the Hong Kong-based crypto entrepreneur and his affiliated companies. As well as its single-largest known investor, at a disclosed amount of $75 million, Sun has become an advisor to the project.\nRepresentatives for Sun did not reply to requests for comment.\nTrump has promised sweeping changes in the regulation of crypto to popularize its mainstream use in America. The Trump family has opened multiple beachheads in crypto, gaining hundreds of millions of dollars through related ventures.\nThe SEC took a strict stance on cryptocurrency under Gary Gensler, the Democratic chair under President Joe Biden. Uyeda’s SEC has created a task force to work with the industry, led by Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce, known for her favorable stance towards the sector. It also downsized the crypto enforcement team by moving lawyers working in that group elsewhere, Reuters has reported.\nWorld Liberty announced on March 25 it planned to launch a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, called USD1.\nDuring the meeting about stablecoin legislation on Wednesday, Waters said she would not support the bill unless President Trump was blocked from owning a stablecoin business through World Liberty.\n\"With this stablecoin bill, this committee is setting an unacceptable and dangerous precedent, validating the president and his insiders' efforts to write rules of the road that will enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else,\" she said."
