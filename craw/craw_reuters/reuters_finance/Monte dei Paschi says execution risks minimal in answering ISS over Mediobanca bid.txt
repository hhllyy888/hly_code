    "content": "MILAN, March 31 (Reuters) - Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), opens new tab said on Monday execution risks in its proposed bid for Mediobanca (MDBI.MI), opens new tab would be minimal given the lack of overlap, as it addressed criticism of the deal by a leading governance adviser.\nOn Friday, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended Monte dei Paschi (MPS) shareholders vote against a share issue needed for the acquisition at the April 17 general meeting.\nISS said the deal could potentially create 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) in additional value, but said that it was hard to achieve, citing the challenge of post-merger integration and the two groups' \"different business profile and culture\".\nMPS has said the logic behind the deal is to create a diversified group with varied sources of revenue to withstand an increasingly challenging environment for banks.\nA traditional retail bank with strong local roots, MPS was rescued by the state in 2017 and has since returned to profit and dividends under Chief Executive Luigi Lovaglio, who took over in 2022.\nUnder long-standing CEO Alberto Nagel, Mediobanca's business has expanded into consumer finance and wealth management, next to its traditional corporate and investment banking activities.\nMediobanca derives a good chunk of yearly profits from its stake in insurer Generali (GASI.MI), opens new tab.\nIn its rebuttal letter to the proxy adviser, MPS said that the \"high complementary of the two business models significantly reduces the risk of execution.\"\n\"The integration process is expected to encounter minimal disruption as it requires fewer efforts than standard M&A transactions involving overlapping businesses.\"\nThe Tuscan bank also noted that its banking operations were bigger than Mediobanca's in terms of assets, as it addressed ISS concerns aver Mediobanca's larger size relative to that of its suitor.\n\"From an operational point of view, the transaction involves comparable businesses,\" it said, reiterating its view that Mediobanca's market value benefits from its 13% Generali stake.($1 = 0.9244 euros)"
