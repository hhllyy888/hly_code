Even if earnings in the first quarter aren't down badly, we're going to see a lot of language from companies about the expected impact from the tariffs.\"\nQuarterly earnings season will kick off later this week, with JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley (MS.N), opens new tab and Wells Fargo (WFC.N), opens new tab set to report on Friday.\nThe S&P 500 (.SPX), opens new tab edged nearer to confirmation of a bear market, finishing almost 19% below its record close on Feb. 19. A bear would be 20% below.\nThe benchmark lost 79.48 points, or 1.57%, to close at 4,982.77 on Tuesday. The last time it closed below 5,000 was April 19 last year.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI), opens new tab fell 320.01 points, or 0.84%, to close at 37,645.59, while the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC), opens new tab lost 335.35 points, or 2.15%, to end at 15,267.91.\nAfter falling as low as 36.48 points earlier in the day, the CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX), opens new tab - seen as Wall Street's 'fear gauge' - gathered steam again to close at 52.33 points, which was its highest closing level since March 2020 in its fourth straight day of advances.\nWorries that the aggressive U.S. tariffs could spur inflation and hamper global growth have led to some to believe Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts could follow.\nBut San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said on Tuesday afternoon that with the economy strong and a lot still unclear on the effect of new policies of the Trump administration, the central bank should not rush to adjust interest rates.\nIn individual stocks, health insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N), opens new tab climbed 5.4% and Humana (HUM.N), opens new tab jumped 10.7% after the U.S. announced a 5.06% increase in payment rates to private insurers for 2026 Medicare Advantage health plans.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3.03-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 17 new highs and 1,132 new lows.\nOn the Nasdaq, 1,002 stocks rose and 3,492 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3.49-to-1 ratio.\nThe S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 109 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 568 new lows.\nOn U.S. exchanges 23.45 billion shares changed hands, well above the 17.35 billion average for the last 20 sessions, but below Monday's record 29.45 billion trades."
