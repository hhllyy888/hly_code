    "content": "FRANKFURT, March 27 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), opens new tab has extended CEO Christian Sewing's contract through April 2029, it said on Thursday, while two executives will leave Germany's biggest lender in a sweeping management revamp.\nFabrizio Campelli, who runs the investment bank, will also assume regional responsibility for the Americas, starting from May, replacing Stefan Simon who is leaving the lender \"for personal reasons,\" Deutsche Bank said in a statement.\nSimon was also chief legal officer.\nThe Frankfurt-based bank also said Raja Akram will replace Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke next year. Akram joins from Morgan Stanley where he has been deputy CFO since 2020, the lender said.\nUnder Sewing, who became CEO in 2018, Deutsche has restructured, exiting businesses such as equities trading and shedding thousands of jobs in a bid to bolster profitability.\nThe bank had been dogged by billions of dollars in fines and was struggling to compete with Wall Street firms.\nIts shares have roughly doubled since Sewing took over, outperforming the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index, which is up about 50% in the same period.\nSewing is now striving to meet a series of ambitious profit and cost targets and some analysts have been sceptical that the bank will reach all its goals.\nIn January, Sewing said that Deutsche Bank could exit some businesses after fourth quarter and full-year profit fell more than expected, with investment banking revenue gains eroded by legal provisions and restructuring costs. The bank also abandoned a key cost target.\nStill, Germany's bold move to ease longstanding caps on government spending is a positive for the lender and economic growth in Europe's largest economy, analysts at RBC said in a note to clients on March 24.\n(This story has been corrected to remove the word 'temporary' in paragraph 2)"
