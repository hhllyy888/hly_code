It went on a buying spree last year to add infrastructure specialist Global Infrastructure Partners, private credit provider HPS and private data firm Preqin.\nPrivate assets, unlike publicly traded stocks and bonds, are typically not listed, are traded less frequently and their pricing can be opaque, raising potential risks for retail investors.\nFink even suggested the private assets could reshape the standard investment portfolio from 60% stocks and 40% bonds to one that would be 50% stocks, 30% bonds and 20% private assets.\n\"While these private assets may carry greater risk, they also provide great benefits\" including inflation protection, stability and returns, Fink wrote.\nBlackRock's size has made Fink's letters closely watched. In 2020 he called on companies to do more to tackle climate change, and BlackRock began to pay more attention to other social issues like workforce diversity. The shift prompted a backlash from Republican politicians, many from energy-producing states, putting BlackRock on the defensive and leading it to quit environmentally focused investor groups.\nThe exits have helped bring BlackRock back into Republicans' good graces along with a recent agreement to purchase two ports on both sides of the Panama Canal, although that deal still faces challenges from international trade tensions.\nFink did not mention the political shifts in his letter. He did however include a warning that the U.S. dollar's status as the world's reserve currency is \"not guaranteed to last forever\" amid growing payments on the national debt.\n\"If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,\" Fink wrote."
