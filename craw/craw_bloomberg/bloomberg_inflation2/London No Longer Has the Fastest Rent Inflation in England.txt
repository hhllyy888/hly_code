    "content": "London’s rent inflation eased to levels last seen two years ago, official data show, in a welcome sign for those struggling with cost-of-living pressures in the UK’s most expensive housing market.\nAverage private housing rents in the capital still rose 9.1% in the year through March to £2,243 ($2,975.7) per month,figuresfrom the Office for National Statistics showed Wednesday. However, it was the weakest increase since May 2023 and a slowdown from a peak of 11.5% at the end of last year. Rents edged up just 0.3% on the month."
