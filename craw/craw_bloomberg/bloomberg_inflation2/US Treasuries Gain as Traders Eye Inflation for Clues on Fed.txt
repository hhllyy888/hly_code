    "content": "Treasuries gained ahead of the release of US inflation data, paring sharp losses sparked by the temporary US-China trade truce that’s dimmed the odds of a global recession.\nWith market-implied expectations for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts receding and a multi-trillion-dollar tax package seen likely to worsen the US government budget deficit, focus is now on Tuesday’s inflation data for any signs of a pickup in price pressures. The report will be the first to show tariff-related costs."
