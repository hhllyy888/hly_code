    "content": "Zambia’s annual consumer-price inflation is set to dip below 8% by year-end, the secretary to the treasury said, which would be the first time it falls within the central bank’s target range since 2019.\nPrice growth in the copper-rich southern African nation reached nearly 25% in 2021, months after Zambia became Africa’s first pandemic-era sovereign defaulter, and this year it touched 16.8% in the wake of a crippling drought."
