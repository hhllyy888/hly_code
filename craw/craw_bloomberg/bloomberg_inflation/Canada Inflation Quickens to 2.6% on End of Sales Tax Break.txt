    "content": "Inflation in Canada grew at the fastest pace in eight months, further limiting the central bankâ€™s ability to cut interest rates amid a trade war that will both slow economic growth and boost prices.\nThe consumer price index rose at a 2.6% yearly pace last month, the highest rate since June and up from 1.9% in January, Statistics Canada said Tuesday. The index jumped 1.1% on a monthly basis in February, the fastest pace in nearly three years. Both figures exceeded economist expectations in a Bloomberg survey."
