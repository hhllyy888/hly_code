    "content": "The rising price of store cupboard staples and alcoholic drinks has lifted UK food inflation to a nine-month high, as the country’s Labour government faces growing political pressure over living costs.\nThe British Retail Consortium said Tuesday that food prices climbed 2.4% in the year to March, faster than the 2.1% increase previously. The cost of ambient food — such as tins, cans and jars kept at room temperature — jumped 3.7%, a sharp acceleration from a 2.8% increase in February."
