Jack Ma founded the company and its affiliate, Alibaba.\nBloomberg reported Monday, citing sources, that Ant has used chips from Alibaba and Huawei for training AI models. Ant also used Nvidia chips but now relies more on alternatives from Advanced Micro Devices and Chinese chips, according to the Bloomberg report.\nAnt did declined CNBC's request for comment.\nThe company on Monday announced \"major upgrades\" to its AI solutions for healthcare, which it said were being used by seven major hospitals and healthcare institutions in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Ningbo.\nThe healthcare AI model is built on DeepSeek's R1 and V3 models, Alibaba's Qwen and Ant's own BaiLing. Ant's healthcare-specific model is able to answer questions about medical topics, and can also help improve patient services, according to the company statement.\nThe U.S. has sought to restrict China's AI development by limiting Chinese businesses' access to the most advanced semiconductors used for training models. Nvidia can still sell its lower-end chips to China."
