    "content": "key point \nCiti on Tuesday became one of the first investment firms to lower its China growth forecast on escalating trade tensions with the U.S.\nGoldman Sachs analysts on Tuesday cautioned that additional U.S. tariffs on China have a diminishing negative impact on the world's second-largest economy. \nDiminishing impact from tariffs can also feed into Beijing's calculus that U.S. leverage is likely reaching a ceiling, Yue Su, principal economist, China, at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said in an email.\nBEIJING — Citi on Tuesday became one of the first investment firms to lower its China growth forecast on escalating trade tensions with the U.S.\nIn less than a week, U.S. tariffs on goods from China have more than doubled, while Beijing has hit back with more duties and restrictions on U.S. businesses.\nCiti analysts cut their forecast for China's gross domestic product to 4.2% this year, down by 0.5 percentage point, as they see \"little scope for a deal between the U.S. and China after recent escalations.\"\nNatixis on Monday also told reporters the firm was cutting its China GDP forecast to 4.2% this year, down from 4.7% previously.\nMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have not yet cut their forecasts, but warned this week of increasing downside risks to their expectation — currently both predict 4.5% growth.\nChina in March announced its official growth target would be \"around 5%\" for 2025, but stressed that it would not be easy to reach the goal."
