The U.S. has twice increased tariffs across all Chinese goods since January, but Beijing has only announced targeted duties and restrictions on a handful of American companies.\nConversation on the sidelines of the state-organized China Development Forum this week in Beijing reinforced a more conciliatory stance than official rhetoric this month about how China is prepared to fight \"any type of war\" with the United States.\nChinese conference attendees weren't that focused on what can be done to respond to U.S. tariffs,  Stephen Roach, senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center, told CNBC.\n\"The questions I've been getting more [are], why is Trump doing this? What is he trying to achieve? What does he think it takes to really make America great?\" Roach said. He has attended the event since the early 2000s."
