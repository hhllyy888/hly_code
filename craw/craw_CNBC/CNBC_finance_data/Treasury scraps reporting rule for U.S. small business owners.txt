    "content": "key point \nThe Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, issued a rule that exempts all U.S. companies and U.S. owners from filing reports about \"beneficial ownership information.\"\nLawmakers sought such information to help curb criminal activity and illicit finance conducted through opaque shell companies. It came with financial penalties for noncompliance.\nThe move is part of a broader deregulatory push by the Trump administration.\nThe U.S. Department of Treasury is scrapping a requirement for U.S. small businesses to report information about their owners to the federal government. It's the latest twist in an on-again, off-again saga for the fledgling rule.\nThe Corporate Transparency Act, passed in 2021, required millions of businesses to report basic information on their \"beneficial owners.\" By identifying who owned certain entities, lawmakers sought to curb criminal activity and illicit finance conducted through opaque shell companies.\nThe rule was set to take effect on March 21, following months of delays in court. It carried financial penalties, potentially thousands of dollars, for noncompliance.\nHowever, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network — also known as FinCEN, which is part of the Treasury — issued an interim final rule on March 21 exempting all U.S. citizens and U.S. companies from the reporting requirement.\nThe rule is open to public comment and set to be finalized later this year."
