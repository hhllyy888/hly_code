    "content": "key point \nProbability of a recession rose to 36% from 23% in January, according to the CNBC Fed Survey, which polls fund managers, strategists and analysts.\nThe average 2025 GDP forecast declined to 1.7% from 2.4% with tariffs now seen as the top threat to the U.S. economy, replacing inflation.\nThree-quarters of respondents forecast two or more quarter-point cuts this year.\nRespondents to the March CNBC Fed Survey have raised the risk of recession to the highest level in six months, cut their growth forecast for 2025 and hiked their inflation outlook.\nMuch of the change appears to stem from concern over fiscal policies from the Trump administration, especially tariffs, which are now seen by them as the top threat to the U.S. economy, replacing inflation. The outlook for the S&P 500 declined for the first time since September.\nThe 32 survey respondents, who include fund managers, strategists and analysts, raised the probability of recession to 36% from 23% in January. The January number had dropped to a three-year low and looked to have reflected initial optimism following the election of President Donald Trump.  But like many consumer and business surveys, the recession probability now shows considerable concern about the outlook.\n\"We've had an abundance of discussions with investors who are increasingly concerned the Trump agenda has gone off the rails due to trade policy,\" said Barry Knapp of Ironsides Macroeconomics. \"Consequently, the economic risks of something more insidious than a soft patch are growing.\"\n\"The degree of policy volatility is unprecedented,'' said John Donaldson, director of fixed income at Haverford Trust.\nThe average GDP forecast for 2025 declined to 1.7% from 2.4%, a sharp markdown that ended consecutive increases in the three prior surveys dating back to September. Gross domestic product is forecast to bounce back to 2.1% in 2026, in line with prior forecasts."
