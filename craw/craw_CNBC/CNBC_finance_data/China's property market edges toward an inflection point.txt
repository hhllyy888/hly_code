That's according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks.\n\"Of course these signals aren't nationwide, and may be local,\" Lam said. \"But compared to the past, it should be more positive.\"\nOne indicator is improving sales in China's largest cities.\nExisting home sales in five major Chinese cities have climbed by more than 30% from a year ago on a weekly basis as of Wednesday, according to CNBC analysis of data accessed via Wind Information. The category is typically called \"secondary home sales\" in China, in contrast to the primary market, which has typically consisted of newly built apartment homes.\nUBS now predicts China's home prices can stabilize in early 2026, earlier than the mid-2026 timeframe previously forecast. They expect secondary transactions could reach half of the total by 2026."
