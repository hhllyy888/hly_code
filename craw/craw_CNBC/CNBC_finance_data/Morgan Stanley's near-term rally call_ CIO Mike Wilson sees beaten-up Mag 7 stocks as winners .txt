    "content": "Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson sees a meaningful rotation back into U.S. stocks, and he sees one beaten-up group as a winner.\n\"It started out with a low-quality rally, which is what we expect – meaning a short squeeze,\" the firm's chief investment officer told CNBC's \"Fast Money\" on Monday. \"Then, what we noticed is the revision factors on the Mag Seven are actually starting to stabilize a bit. So, the last couple of days though stocks have acted better, and that can take the index higher. How high? 5,900. So, we're almost there.\"\nThe major indexes had a notable start to the week. The S&P 500 gained roughly 1.8% and closed at 5,767.57 — about 6% below its all-time high. Meanwhile, the Dow jumped almost 600 points while the Nasdaq Composite surged more than 2%.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" had a big role in Monday's rally. Its members include Apple, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Tesla. The electric vehicle maker registered its best daily performance since November.\nBut Wilson, who's also the firm's chief U.S. equity strategist, suggests a narrow window for gains. He focused his Monday research note on the idea.\n\"Stronger seasonals, lower rates and oversold momentum indicators support our call for a tradeable rally from ~5500,\" he wrote. \"A weaker dollar and stabilizing Mag 7 EPS [earnings per share] revisions can drive capital back to the US. Beyond the tactical rally, volatility will likely persist this year.\"\nAnd, he won't rule out new lows for the year.\n\"Whatever rally we're getting now, we think probably end up fading into earnings, into May and June,\" he added. \"Then, we'll probably make a more durable low later in the year.\"\nAccording to Wilson, the market weakness is mostly tied to fundamentals and technicals."
