    "content": "Shares of conservative news channel Newsmax plunged more than 70% on Wednesday as its meteoric rise as a new public company proved to be short-lived.\nThe stock tumbled a whopping 77.5%, following a 2,230% surge in Newsmax's first two days of trading after debuting on the New York Stock Exchange. At one point, the rally gave the company a market capitalization of nearly $30 billion, surpassing the market cap of legacy media companies such as Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox Corp."
