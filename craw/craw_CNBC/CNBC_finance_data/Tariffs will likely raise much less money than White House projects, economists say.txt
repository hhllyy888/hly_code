    "content": "key point \nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro estimated the U.S. would raise about $600 billion to $700 billion a year from tariffs. \nEconomists say the true number will probably be less than half of that sum. Much depends on the actual policies, though.\nPresident Donald Trump is preparing to unveil more tariffs against trade partners on Wednesday.\nPresident Donald Trump says that tariffs will make the U.S. \"rich.\" But those riches will likely be far less than the White House expects, economists said.\nThe ultimate sum could have big ramifications for the U.S. economy, the nation's debt and legislative negotiations over a tax-cut package, economists said.\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Sunday estimated tariffs would raise about $600 billion a year and $6 trillion over a decade. Auto tariffs would add another $100 billion a year, he said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\nNavarro made the projection as the U.S. plans to announce more tariffs against U.S. trading partners on Wednesday.\nEconomists expect the Trump administration's tariff policy would generate a much lower amount of revenue than Navarro claims. Some project the total revenue would be less than half.\nRoughly $600 billion to $700 billion a year \"is not even in the realm of possibility,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's. \"If you get to $100 billion to $200 billion, you'll be pretty lucky.\"\nThe White House declined to respond to a request for comment from CNBC about tariff revenue."
