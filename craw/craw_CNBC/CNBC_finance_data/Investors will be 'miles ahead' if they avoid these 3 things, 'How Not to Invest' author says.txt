    "content": "key point \nMany people are bad investors largely because they aren't skeptical enough: They react emotionally and they don't understand compound interest, said Barry Ritholtz, chairman and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management.\nFamous investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch who consistently beat the market are rare, Ritholtz said.\nBarry Ritholtz had a hard time writing his first book, \"Bailout Nation.\"\nDrafted in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, the biggest challenge, he said, was that a different company \"would blow up\" every week.\nIt felt as if the writing \"was never over,\" said Ritholtz, the chairman and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management, an investment advisory firm that manages more than $5 billion of assets.\nBy comparison, the new book was a \"joy\" to write, largely due to the benefit hindsight, said Ritholtz, who is also a prolific blogger and creator of the long-running finance podcast \"Masters in Business.\"\nThe book, \"How Not to Invest: The Ideas, Numbers, and Behaviors That Destroy Wealth — And How to Avoid Them,\" published March 18, is a history lesson of sorts.\nMore from Personal Finance:Why the father of 'life planning' says you're managing money the wrong wayIt's not always 'a sexy thing' to be a millionaire, former NFL linebacker saysTake a look inside a $1.1 million 'zero emissions' home\nRitholtz looks back at anecdotes across pop culture and finance — touching on Hollywood titans like Steven Spielberg, music sensations like The Beatles, and corporate pariahs like Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos — to illustrate the disconnect between how much people think they know and what they actually know. (Ritholtz' point being, The Beatles and films like \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" were initially panned; Holmes, initially lauded, is now serving jail time.)\n\"It's a huge advantage to say, 'I know how the game ended,'\" Ritholtz said. \"What the analysts were saying in the second, third, fourth inning, they didn't know what they're talking about.\"\nCNBC spoke to Ritholtz about why people are often bad investors, why famous investors like Warren Buffett are \"mutants,\" and why financial advice about buying $5 lattes is the cliché that just won't die.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."
