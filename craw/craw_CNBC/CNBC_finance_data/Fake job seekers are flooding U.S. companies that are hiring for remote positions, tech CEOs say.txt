    "content": "key point \nCompanies are facing a new threat: Job seekers who aren't who they say they are, using AI tools to fabricate photo IDs, generate employment histories and provide answers during interviews.\nThe rise of AI-generated profiles means that by 2028 globally 1 in 4 job candidates will be fake, according to research and advisory firm Gartner.\nOnce hired, an impostor can install malware to demand a ransom from a company, or steal its customer data, trade secrets or funds.\nWhen voice authentication startup Pindrop Security posted a recent job opening, one candidate stood out from hundreds of others.\nThe applicant, a Russian coder named Ivan, seemed to have all the right qualifications for the senior engineering role. When he was interviewed over video last month, however, Pindrop's recruiter noticed that Ivan's facial expressions were slightly out of sync with his words.\nThat's because the candidate, whom the firm has since dubbed \"Ivan X,\" was a scammer using deepfake software and other generative AI tools in a bid to get hired by the tech company, said Pindrop CEO and co-founder Vijay Balasubramaniyan.\n\"Gen AI has blurred the line between what it is to be human and what it means to be machine,\" Balasubramaniyan said. \"What we're seeing is that individuals are using these fake identities and fake faces and fake voices to secure employment, even sometimes going so far as doing a face swap with another individual who shows up for the job.\"\nCompanies have long fought off attacks from hackers hoping to exploit vulnerabilities in their software, employees or vendors. Now, another threat has emerged: Job candidates who aren't who they say they are, wielding AI tools to fabricate photo IDs, generate employment histories and provide answers during interviews.\nThe rise of AI-generated profiles means that by 2028 globally 1 in 4 job candidates will be fake, according to research and advisory firm Gartner.\nThe risk to a company from bringing on a fake job seeker can vary, depending on the person's intentions. Once hired, the impostor can install malware to demand ransom from a company, or steal its customer data, trade secrets or funds, according to Balasubramaniyan. In many cases, the deceitful employees are simply collecting a salary that they wouldn't otherwise be able to, he said."
