    "content": "key point \nE-commerce giants have reported stronger year-on-year revenue growth in the last three months of 2024, indicating recovery in consumption growth — but not back to pre-pandemic levels.\nHowever, the earnings released by certain companies reveal strong consumer spending in niche areas, with companies such as Laopu Gold and Pop Mart seeing a surge in revenues.\nCompetition remains fierce in certain market segments, such as coffee and tea.\nBEIJING — Chinese companies' latest earnings reports point to an improvement in consumer spending, though it's not necessarily back to pre-pandemic levels.\nE-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com both said in the last several weeks that their China retail business saw faster year-on-year revenue growth in the last three months of 2024 than in 2023.\n\"We think consumption growth is in a period of healthy recovery, but not [yet reaching] the high previously,\" Charlie Chen, managing director and head of Asia research at China Renaissance Securities, said Wednesday in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.\nFor consumer spending to return to pre-pandemic growth, Chinese companies' revenue growth likely needs to recover by double digits and consumer confidence needs to improve, Chen said. He noted that the recent real estate slump has weighed on consumers' sense of affluence.\nChinese policymakers have emphasized that boosting consumption is their priority this year. So far, authorities have expanded a trade-in subsidy program to include smartphones, on top of home appliances and electric cars. In September, Beijing also signaled a shift in real estate policy by calling for a halt in the market decline."
