For China's exporters, it means raising prices for Americans while accelerating plans to diversify operations — and, in some cases, stopping shipments entirely.\nU.S. consumers could lose access to certain products in June since some American companies have halted their plans to import textiles from China, said Ryan Zhao, director at Jiangsu Green Willow Textile.\nFor products that continue to be shipped from China, \"it's impossible to predict\" by how much their prices will rise for U.S. consumers, he said Thursday in Chinese, translated by CNBC. \"It takes two to four months for products to be shipped from China's ports and arrive on U.S. supermarket shelves. In the last two months tariffs have climbed from 10% to 125% today.\"\nThe White House has confirmed the U.S. tariff rate on Chinese goods was effectively at 145%. Triple-digit tariffs essentially cut off most trade, a Tax Foundation economist told CNBC's \"The Exchange.\"\nBut U.S.-China trade relationship won't change overnight, even as American companies that source from China are looking for alternatives."
