    "content": "It appears T. Rowe Price is benefiting from the record growth in actively managed exchange-traded funds.\nTim Coyne, the firm's head of ETFs, reports T. Rowe Price is seeing significant growth in the area — listing the T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Equity ETF (TCAF) and T. Rowe Price U.S. Equity Research ETF (TSPA) as two established strategies that can satisfy investor demand.\n\"I think having that professionally managed portfolio is really beneficial to clients,\" Coyne told CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" this week. \"We're seeing just … greater volatility [and] uncertainty across both the equity and fixed income markets.\"\nAccording to Coyne, the T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Equity ETF suits investors who are looking for long-term growth.\n\"The objective of the fund is to outperform the S&P 500 with lower volatility and greater tax efficiency,\" he said. \"It's also a more concentrated portfolio, typically holding around a hundred names.\"\nAs of April 24, the fund's top holdings include Microsoft, Amazon and Apple according to the T. Rowe Price website. But it's not all Big Tech. The ETF also features smaller positions in companies like Becton Dickinson and Roper Technologies.\nThe T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Equity ETF is down about 5% so far this year while the S&P 500 is off about 7%. However, the ETF is up close to 8% over the past year — roughly identical to the S&P 500's performance.\nCoyne notes the T. Rowe Price U.S. Equity Research ETF follows a similar strategy, but with a heavier weighting in top tech stocks.\n\"This is more of a large-cap growth product [T Rowe Price U.S. Equity Research ETF],\" he said. \"There are components of characteristics of both passive and active here. This fund is actually managed by our North American directors of research. So again, strong fundamental research is going into the stock selection.\"\nBoth the T. Rowe Price U.S. Equity Research ETF and S&P 500 are down around 7% since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, the fund is up almost 9% over the past year. That's less than 1 percent better than the S&P 500's performance."
