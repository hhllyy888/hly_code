Investment banking increased 8% to $1.56 billion, just under the $1.61 billion estimate.\nWealth management revenue jumped 6% to $7.33 billion, matching the estimate.\nShares of Morgan Stanley, like those of its peers, have whipsawed in recent days as President Donald Trump's trade policies have increased concern that the U.S. was headed for a recession.\nThe bank's massive wealth management business was helped by high stock market values in the first quarter, which inflates the management fees it collects.\nAnalysts will want to ask about the outlook for mergers and IPO listings, which may be curtailed amid the tensions."
