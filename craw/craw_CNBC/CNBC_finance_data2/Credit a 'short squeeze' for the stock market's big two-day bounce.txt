    "content": "key point \nA key force at the center of the stock market's massive two-day rally is the frantic behavior of short sellers covering their losses.\nShort covering was on display Tuesday and Wednesday as stocks shot up on signs of easing tensions on trade even though no concrete deals have been reached yet.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday \"there is an opportunity for a big deal here\" on trade issues between the U.S. and China.\nA key force at the center of the stock market's massive two-day rally is the frantic behavior of short sellers covering their losses.\nHedge fund short sellers recently added more bearish wagers in both single stocks and securities tied to macro developments after the whipsaw early April triggered by President Donald Trump's tariff rollout and abrupt 90-day pause, according to Goldman Sachs' prime brokerage data.\nThe increased short positions in the market created an environment prone to dramatic upswings due to this artificial buying force. A short seller borrows an asset and quickly sells it. When the security decreases in price, they buy it back more cheaply to profit from the difference.\nIt can backfire when the security suddenly rallies and short sellers are forced to buy back their borrowed stocks rapidly to limit their losses, a Wall Street phenomenon known as a short squeeze.\nIf the market appeared to be rallying on no real tangible news Tuesday other than some walking back of comments on China and the Federal Reserve by Trump, credit this phenomenon.\n\"Squeeze risk is real today,\" John Flood, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, said in an early note to clients Wednesday.\nFlood echoed the sentiment of many traders who have said the market appeared coiled for a relief rally because so many hedge funds were caught on the wrong side of this bet."
