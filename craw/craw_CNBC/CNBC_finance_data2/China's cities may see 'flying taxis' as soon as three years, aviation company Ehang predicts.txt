    "content": "key point \nEhang earlier this week said it was the first in the world to obtain a certificate for operating a pilotless aerial vehicle that can carry humans.\nThe certification clears the way for flying taxis to become a viable method of transportation in some Chinese cities over the next three to five years.\nAnalysts and researchers say the certification shows how China is a leading innovator in the future of transportation and mobility.\nFlying taxis will become a viable method of transportation in China in the next three to five years, according to a senior executive at Ehang, a company that makes autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs).\nThe prediction by Ehang's Vice President He Tianxing comes days after the company became the first company, along with its joint venture partner Hefei Heyi Aviation, to obtain a certificate to operate \"civil human-carrying pilotless aerial vehicles\" from the Civil Aviation Administration of China.\nEhang said the certification clears the way for commercial operations of its vehicles, allowing for paid human-carrying services and any other low-altitude use cases the company develops.\nAt first, Ehang's AAVs will be used for tourism, with passengers able to ride along designated routes in Guangzhou and Hefei by the end of June, He told CNBC in an interview translated from Mandarin.\nThe company will gradually explore air taxi services as its tourist operations progress. He named Hefei and Shenzhen as examples of some of the first cities expected to get air taxi services.\nEhang's EH216-S, which received the certification, is a fully electric, pilotless two-seater aerial vehicle that features 16 propellers, according to Ehang's website.Â It has a maximum design speed of 130 kilometers per hour, with a maximum range of 30 kilometers."
