The country subsequently downplayed the initiative, but has doubled-down on domestic tech development given U.S. restrictions in the last several years.\nSince releasing the plan, China has exceeded its targets on achieving domestic dominance in autos, but the country has not yet reached its targets in aerospace, high-end robots and the growth rate of manufacturing value-added, the business chamber said, citing its research and discussions with members. Out of ten strategic sectors identified in the report, China only attained technological dominance in shipbuilding, high-speed rail and electric cars.\nChina's targets are generally seen as a direction rather than an actual figure to be achieved by a specific date. The Made In China 2025 plan outlines the first ten years of what the country called a 'multi-decade strategy' to become a global manufacturing powerhouse.\nThe chamber pointed out that China's self-developed airplane, the C919, still relies heavily on U.S. and European parts and though industrial automation levels have \"increased substantially,\" it is primarily due to foreign technology. In addition, the growth rate of manufacturing value add reached 6.1% in 2024, falling from the 7% rate in 2015 and just over halfway toward reaching the target of 11%.\n\"Everyone should consider themselves lucky that China missed its manufacturing growth target,\" Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, told reporters Tuesday, since the reverse would have exacerbated pressure on global competitors. \"They didn't fulfill their own target, but I actually think they did astoundingly well.\""
