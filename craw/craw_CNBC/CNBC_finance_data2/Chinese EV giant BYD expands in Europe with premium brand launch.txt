The company did not specify prices or a delivery date for the station wagon-type car.\nThe Z9GT for Europe will come in both battery-only and plug-in hybrid versions, BYD said.\nBYD already sells electric cars in Europe. The company initially formed the Denza brand in 2010 with Daimler, now the Mercedes-Benz Group. The sub-brand was revamped in 2021 and sells cars in China, with the German automaker reducing its equity interest to 10%.\nThe European Union last year announced 17% duties on imports of BYD battery electric vehicles over claims of \"unfair\" production subsidies. Last month, Chinese and EU officials discussed issues related to the electric car supply chain during a meeting in Beijing."
