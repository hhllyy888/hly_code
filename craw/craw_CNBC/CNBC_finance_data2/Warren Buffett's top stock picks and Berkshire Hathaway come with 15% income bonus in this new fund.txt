    "content": "key point \nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is one of this year's top performing stocks.\nA new ETF is tracking Buffett's favorite companies, and adding a 15% income component to boost shareholder returns in a volatile market.\nBerkshire is holding a record amount of cash, and has never paid a dividend to shareholders.\nIn a year that hasn't been kind to many big-name stocks, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is standing near the top. Berkshire shares have posted a 17% return year-to-date, while the S&P 500 index is down 6%.\nThat performance places Berkshire among the top 10% of the U.S. market's large-cap leaders, and the run has been getting Buffett more attention ahead of next weekend's annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. It's also good timing for the recently launched VistaShares Target 15 Berkshire Select Income ETF (OMAH), which holds the top 20 most heavily weighted stocks in Berkshire Hathaway, as well as shares of Berkshire Hathaway.\nBerkshire is currently the biggest holding in the ETF, at 10.6% of the fund. Other top holdings in the ETF from among the ranks of Berkshire's biggest bets include Apple, American Express, Kroger, VeriSign, Bank of America, Citigroup, Visa and of course Coca-Cola, a long time favorite of the man known as the Oracle of Omaha.\n\"It's a really well-balanced portfolio chosen by the most successful investor the world has ever seen,\" Adam Patti, CEO of VistaShares, said in an appearance this week on CNBC's \"ETF Edge.\"\nBerkshire's outperformance of the S&P 500 isn't limited to 2025. Buffett's stock has tripled the performance of the market over the past year, and its 185% return over the past five years is more than double the performance of the S&P 500."
