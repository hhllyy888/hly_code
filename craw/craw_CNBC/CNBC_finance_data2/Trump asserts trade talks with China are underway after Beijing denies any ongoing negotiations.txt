It doesn't matter who 'they' is. We may reveal it later, but they had meetings this morning, and we've been meeting with China,\" Trump told reporters.\nThe statement followed China's denial of any talks with the U.S. and calls for abolishing \"unilateral\" tariff measures for resolving trade issues.\n\"At present there are absolutely no negotiations on the economy and trade between China and the U.S.,\" Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. He added that \"all sayings\" regarding progress on bilateral talks should be dismissed.\n\"If the U.S. really wants to resolve the problem ... it should cancel all the unilateral measures on China,\" He said.\nTrump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week indicated that there could be an easing in tensions with China. The White House earlier this month added 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, to which Beijing responded with duties of its own and increased restrictions on critical minerals exports to the U.S.\nThe Commerce Ministry's comments echoed those of Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun, who said on Thursday afternoon that there were no ongoing talks, according to state media.\nBoth spokespersons held to the official line that China would be willing to talk to the U.S. subject to Beijing being treated as an equal."
