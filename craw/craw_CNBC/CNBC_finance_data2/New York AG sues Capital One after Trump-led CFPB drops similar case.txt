That suit alleged Capital One's marketing led U.S. customers to miss out on more than $2 billion in interest.\nThe dropped CFPB case is among a slew of other enforcement lawsuits that the agency pursued under previous CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, and that have been dismissed by President Donald Trump's administration.\n\"Capital One assured high returns with no catches, then pulled the rug out from under their customers and hoped nobody would notice,\" James said in a statement Wednesday. \"Big banks are not allowed to cheat their customers with false advertising and misleading promises.\"\nA Capital One spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC that it strongly disagrees with the attorney general's claims and will \"vigorously defend\" itself in court.\n\"Our flagship 360 Performance Savings product was marketed widely, including on national television, and has always been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe bank also disputed the CFPB allegations earlier this year.\nThe New York suit accuses Capital One of violating state and federal law and seeks \"restitution and damages for all affected Capital One customers.\""
