Maxx, spending fell 4% in the first three months of the year, the company said last week.\nThat compares to a 6% spending jump at American Express and a similar rise at JPMorgan Chase, both of which cater to wealthier users with higher credit scores. \nAmerica, at the start of 2025, is a tale of two consumers.\nLower-income earners are reining in their transactions to focus on essentials, while the wealthy continue to spend freely on perks including dining out and luxury travel, according to first-quarter results from U.S. credit card lenders.\nAs anxiety from the opening salvos of President Donald Trump's trade policies rippled through the country in recent months, investors and economists have wondered whether declines in consumer sentiment would spill into the real economy. There are some early signs of stress among those who are already more economically vulnerable.\nFor instance, at Synchrony, which provides store cards for retail brands including Lowe's and T.J. Maxx, spending fell 4% in the first three months of the year, the company said last week.\nThat compares to a 6% spending jump at American Express and a similar rise at JPMorgan Chase, both of which cater to wealthier users with higher credit scores than Synchrony. AmEx said its customers spent 7% more on dining and 11% more on first class and business class airfare than a year earlier.\nWhile the \"consumer is still in pretty good shape\" overall, they are \"being selective around how they spend,\" Synchrony CEO Brian Doubles told analysts on April 22.\nLower-income card users in particular \"started tapering their spend about a year ago,\" pulling back on discretionary and big ticket expenses as inflation ate into their buying power, Doubles said."
