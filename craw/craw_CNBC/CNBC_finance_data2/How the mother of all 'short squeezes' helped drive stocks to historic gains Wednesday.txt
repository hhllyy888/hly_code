Then as the security decreases in price from where they sold it, they buy it back more cheaply and return it to the bank, profiting from the difference.\nBut sometimes that can backfire.\nAs stocks soared on news of the tariff pause, hedge funds were forced to buy back their borrowed stocks rapidly in order to limit their losses, a Wall Street phenomenon known as a short squeeze. With this artificial buying force pushing it higher, the S&P 500 ended up with its third-biggest gain since World War II.\nComing into Wednesday, short positioning was almost twice as much as the size seen in the first quarter of 2020 amid the onset of the Covid pandemic, according to Bank of America. As funds ran to cover, a basket of the most shorted stocks surged by 12.5% on Wednesday, according to Goldman Sachs, pulling off a larger jump than the S&P 500's 9.5% gain.\nAnd a whopping 30 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges during the session, marking the heaviest volume day on record, according to Nasdaq and FactSet data going back 18 years.\n\"You can't catch a move. When you see someone short covering, the exit doors become so small because of these crowded trades,\" said Jeff Kilburg, KKM Financial CEO and CIO. \"We live in a world where there's more and more twitchiness to the marketplace, there's more and more paranoia.\""
