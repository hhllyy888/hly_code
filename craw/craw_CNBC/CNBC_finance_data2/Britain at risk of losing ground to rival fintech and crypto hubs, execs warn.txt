They argued that the local regulator takes too strict an approach to registering new firms, and that pension funds managing trillions of pounds are too risk-averse\nWhereas a decade ago the U.K. was seen as being at \"the forefront in terms of promoting competitiveness and innovation,\" today things \"have shifted more towards prioritizing safety and soundness to an extent where growth has been held behind,\" according to Jaidev Janardana, CEO of British digital bank Zopa.\n\"If I look at the speed of innovation, I do feel that the U.S. is ahead — although they have their own challenges. But look at Singapore, Hong Kong — again, you see much more rapid innovation,\" Janardana told CNBC. \"I think we are still ahead of the EU, but we can't remain complacent with that.\""
