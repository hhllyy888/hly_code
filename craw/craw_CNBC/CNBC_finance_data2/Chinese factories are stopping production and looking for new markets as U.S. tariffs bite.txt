He said factories making toys, sporting goods and low-cost dollar store-type goods are the most affected right now.\n\"While not large-scale yet, it is happening in the key [export] hubs of Yiwu and Dongguan and there is concern that it will grow,\" Johnson said. \"There is a hope that tariffs will be lowered so orders can resume, but in the meantime companies are furloughing employees and idling some production.\"\nAround 10 million to 20 million workers in China are involved with U.S.-bound export businesses, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. The official number of workers in China's cities last year was 473.45 million."
