Time after time, he and his deputies denied that the administration would back off from the highest American tariff regime in a century, sometimes inferring that Wall Street would have to suffer so that Main Street could thrive.\n\"It goes without saying that last week's price action was shocking to see as the market has begun to rewrite completely its sense for what a second Trump presidency means for the economy,\" said R. Scott Siefers, a Piper Sandler analyst, earlier this week.\nSo it came as a huge relief to investors when, minutes after 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Trump relented by rolling back the highest tariffs on most countries except China, sparking the biggest one-day stock rally for the S&P 500 since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis.\nDespite a presidency in which Trump has tested the limits of executive power — bulldozing federal agencies and laying off thousands of government employees, for example — the episode shows that the market, and by proxy Wall Street statesmen like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon who can explain its gyrations, are still guardrails on the administration.\nLater Wednesday afternoon, Trump told reporters that he pivoted after seeing how markets were reacting — getting \"yippy,\" in his words — and took to heart Dimon's warning in a morning TV appearance that the policy was pushing the U.S. economy into recession.\nDimon's appearance in a Fox news interview was planned more than a month ago and wasn't a last-minute decision meant to sway the president, according to a person with knowledge of the JPMorgan CEO's schedule."
