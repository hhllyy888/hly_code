The bank reported profit of 106 million euros for the December quarter.\nRevenues reached 8.524 billion euros over the period, up 10% year-on-year and above a $7.224-billion-euro result in the fourth quarter.\nIn a statement accompanying the results, Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing said the print \"put us on track for delivery on all our 2025 targets\" and marked \"our best quarterly profit for fourteen years.\"\nThe lender's shares were up 2.5% at 08:11 a.m. London time, shortly after the market open.\nOther fourth-quarter highlights included:\nThe lender's core investment banking division posted a 10% year-on-year hike in net revenues to 3.4 billion euros in the first quarter, with a 17% increase in the traditionally strong fixed income and currencies (FIC) unit partially offset by a 8% decline in origination & advisory.\nAsset management net revenues picked up by 18% to 730 million euros in the first quarter.\nDeutsche Bank has relied on its investment arm to bridge diminishing gains from loans as interest rates moved lower. The lender's investment banking operations, the backbone of its growth, expanded by an annual 30% to 2.4 billion euros in the fourth quarter, also increasing 15% year-on-year to 10.6 billion euros across the whole of 2024.\n\"We see momentum across the businesses, and we think that'll carry through for the rest of the year. We're also maintaining expense discipline, and so we beat on both of those lines,\" Deutsche Bank Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke told CNBC's Annette Weisbach on Tuesday.\n\"Overall a solid set of results, but perhaps not as strong as at first glance,\" Citi analysts said in a note, flagging \"core divisional trends are more mixed\" and that the lender's provision guidance \"now includes a caveat for economic uncertainty.\""
