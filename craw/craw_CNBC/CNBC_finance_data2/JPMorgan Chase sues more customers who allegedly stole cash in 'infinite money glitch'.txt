The bank looked at thousands of potential cases, choosing to litigate the largest amounts with the clearest pattern of theft, said the person familiar.\nThe bank has also sent letters to more than 1,000 customers demanding they repay funds since October, this person said. Some people returned money on their own after CNBC reported in October that the bank was going after potential fraudsters who had drawn down the largest amounts, said the person.\nThe lawsuits are separate from potential criminal cases that both federal and state law enforcement may be pursuing, according to the bank.\n\"We're still investigating cases of fraud and cooperating with law enforcement â€” and we'll do that for as long as it takes to hold fraudsters accountable,\" Drew Pusateri, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said in a statement."
