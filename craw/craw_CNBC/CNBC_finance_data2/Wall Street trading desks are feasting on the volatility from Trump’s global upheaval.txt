Instead, deal activity has remained tepid, and the biggest beneficiaries so far have been sitting on bank's trading floors.\nWhile equities traders put up the biggest gains during the first quarter, according to their earnings releases, fixed income personnel also saw higher revenue on rising activity in currencies, commodities and bond markets.\n\"So long as the volatility continues — and there's no reason to believe it's going to stop anytime soon — equities trading desks should remain plenty busy,\" James Shanahan, a bank analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview."
