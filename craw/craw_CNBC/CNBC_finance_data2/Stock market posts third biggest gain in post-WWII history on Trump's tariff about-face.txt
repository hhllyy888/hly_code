    "content": "Wednesday's jaw-dropping stock-market rally on President Donald Trump's surprising tariff reversal is one for the history books.\nThe S&P 500 skyrocketed 9.52% in a kneejerk reaction to Trump's announcement to put a 90-day pause on some of the lofty 'reciprocal' tariffs. The one-day gain ranks as the third biggest since World War II for the main stock market benchmark, according to FactSet."
