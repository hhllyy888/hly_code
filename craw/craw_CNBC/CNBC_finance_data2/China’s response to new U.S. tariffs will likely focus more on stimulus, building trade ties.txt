The sweeping U.S. policy also slapped new duties on the European Union and major Asian countries.\nChinese exports to the U.S. this year had already been hit by 20% in additional tariffs, raising the total rate on shipments from China to 54%, among the highest levied by the Trump administration. The effective rate for individual product lines can vary.\nBut, as has been the case, the closing line of the Chinese statement was a call to negotiate.\n\"I think the focus of China's response in the near term won't be retaliatory tariffs or such measures,\" said Bruce Pang, adjunct associate professor at CUHK Business School. That's according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese-language statement.\nInstead, Pang expects China to focus on improving its own economy by diversifying export destinations and products, as well as doubling down on its priority of boosting domestic consumption."
