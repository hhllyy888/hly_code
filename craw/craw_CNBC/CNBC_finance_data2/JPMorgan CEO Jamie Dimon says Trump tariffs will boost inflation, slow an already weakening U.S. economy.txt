Stocks have been in free fall since Trump's announcement shocked global markets, causing the worst week for U.S. equities since the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in 2020.\nHis remarks appear to backtrack earlier comments he made in January, when Dimon said people should \"get over\" tariff concerns because they were good for national security. At the time, tariff levels being discussed were far lower than what was unveiled last week.\nTrump's tariff policy has created \"many uncertainties,\" including its effect on global capital flows and the dollar, the impact to corporate profits and the response from trading partners, Dimon said.\n\"The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,\" he said. \"In the short run, I see this as one large additional straw on the camel's back.\""
