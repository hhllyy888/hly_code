Her prediction comes after having conversations with participantsÂ in last week's World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington.\n\"There are a large number of foreign investors who are worried not only about tariffs, but just about America's reliability as a partner,\" Patterson said Monday on CNBC's \"Fast Money.\"\nOutside of the Trump administration's tariff policy, she finds foreign investors and policymakers are losing faith in the U.S. on broader fears about the potential weaponizing of capital markets to achieve its economic goals."
