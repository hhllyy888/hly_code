    "content": "key point \nHistory suggests that President Donald Trump's new \"Too Late\" nickname for Fed Chair Jerome Powell has a strong chance of coming true.\n Fed leaders have been criticized as slow to act absent compelling data showing them something needs to be done.\nPowell is in a no-win situation with threats to both sides of the Fed mandate \"and that's why he's doing the exact right thing at this moment, which is nothing, because one way or another it's going to be a mistake,\" economist Dan North said.\nHistory suggests that President Donald Trump's new \"Too Late\" nickname for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has a strong chance of coming true, though he'd hardly be alone if it does.\nAfter all, central bank leaders have a long history of being too reluctant to raise or lower interest rates.\nWhether it was Arthur Burns keeping rates too low in the face of the stagflation threat during the 1970s, Alan Greenspan not responding quickly enough to the dotcom bubble in the '90s, or Ben Bernanke's dismissal of the subprime housing prices as \"contained\" and not lowering rates prior to the 2008 financial crisis, Fed leaders have long been criticized as slow to act absent compelling data showing them something needs to be done.\nSo some economists think Powell, faced with a unique set of challenges to the Fed's twin goals of full employment and low inflation, has a strong chance of wearing the \"Too Late\" label.\nIn fact, many of them think nothing is exactly what Powell should do now.\n\"Historically, go back and look at any Federal Reserve, and I'm going back into the '70s, the Fed is always late both ways,\" said Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America. \"They tend to wait. They want to wait to make sure that they won't make a mistake, and by the time they do that, usually it is too late. The economy is almost always in recession.\""
