The board voted unanimously on Sunday to make Abel president and CEO on Jan. 1, 2026, and for Buffett to remain as chairman.\nBerkshire Class A shares dropped 4.9% to about $769,960, after closing at a record high at $809,350 apiece. Class B shares fell a similar amount to $512.94 after hitting an all-time high at $539.80 on Friday. Berkshire issued Class B shares in 1996 at a price equal to one-thirtieth of a Class A share. In 2010, Berkshire Class B shares split 50-for-1.\n\"Shareholders should welcome this transparent transition, but also have confidence that Warren isn't going anywhere,\" said Macrae Sykes, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds and a Berkshire shareholder. \"Retaining the position of Chairman means he can continue to mentor Greg and the Berkshire leaders, while also providing additional intellectual capacity when the inevitable time for more major capital allocation occurs.\"\nIt marks an end of an epic era for Berkshire, which was a failing New England textile mill six decades ago when Buffett used an investment partnership he ran to take control. Berkshire has grown into a one-of-a-kind juggernaut worth nearly $1.2 trillion with businesses encompassing insurance, railroad, retail, manufacturing and energy. Buffett is handing over his reins on a particularly high note as Berkshire shares just reached a new peak Friday."
