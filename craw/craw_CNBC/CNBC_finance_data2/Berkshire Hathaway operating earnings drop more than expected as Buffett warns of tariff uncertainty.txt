    "content": "key point \nOperating earnings, which include the conglomerate's fully owned insurance and railroad businesses, fell 14% to $9.64 billion during the first three months of the year.\nMuch of that decline was driven by a 48.6% plunge in insurance-underwriting profit. \nBerkshire said President Donald Trump's tariffs and other geopolitical risks created an uncertain environment for the conglomerate, owner of BNSF railway, Brooks Running and Geico insurance.\n(Follow along with our full coverage of Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting here. Warren Buffett begins talking at 9 a.m. ET.)\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter results on Saturday that showed a steep drop in operating earnings from the year-earlier period. The conglomerate, which owns a vast array of insurance, transportation, energy, retail and other businesses also warned that tariffs may further hit profits.\nOperating earnings, which include the conglomerate's fully owned insurance and railroad businesses, fell 14% to $9.64 billion during the first three months of the year. In the first quarter of 2024, they totaled $11.22 billion.\nOn per share basis, operating earnings were $4.47 last quarter, down from $5.20 per class B share in the same period one year ago. That compares to an estimate of $4.89 per class B share from UBS and an overall consensus estimate from 4 analysts of $4.72 a share per FactSet.\nMuch of that decline was driven by a 48.6% plunge in insurance-underwriting profit. That came in at $1.34 billion for the first quarter, down from $2.60 billion a year prior. Berkshire said the Southern California wildfires led to a $1.1 billion loss in Q1.\nBerkshire's bottom line also took a hit from the dollar losing value in the first quarter. The company said it suffered an approximate $713 million loss related to foreign exchange. This time last year, it benefited from a $597 million forex gain.\nThe dollar index fell nearly 4% in the first quarter. Against the Japanese yen, it lost 4.6%."
