    "content": "Check out the companies making headlines in premarket trading:\nTesla — The electric vehicle company pulled back more than 4% after Barclays cut its price target on Tesla, citing \"confusing\" visibility into first-quarter earnings.\nNetflix — The streaming giant's stock added 2% following the company's first-quarter earnings and revenue beat. Netflix also said it sees no significant effect from tariffs. On Monday, several Wall Street analysts increased their price targets on the stock.\nAmazon — Shares of the e-commerce giant ticked 1.7% lower following Raymond James' downgrade to outperform from strong buy. The firm also slashed its price target, citing headwinds tied to tariffs and concerns with the economic backdrop.\nApple — Shares slipped nearly 3% as the company continues to contend with uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs. The iPhone maker is down more than 11% in April.\nAlphabet — The tech giant fell 1.4% after a federal judge last week determined Alphabet holds an illegal monopoly in online advertising markets. That comes ahead of the Google parent's earnings results set to release Thursday.\nSpotify — The streaming music company rose 1% after an upgrade to outperform from peer perform at Wolfe Research. The investment firm said Spotify's moves to diversify away from music should help expand its margins.\nHertz Global — The car rental company dropped nearly 10%, giving back a chunk of its sharp gains from last week. Hertz shares more than doubled last week after billionaire investor Bill Ackman disclosed a stake in the company.\nNewmont — Shares of the gold miner climbed more than 3% as the precious metal climbed to fresh record highs above $3,400 per ounce. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) also traded over 3% higher.\n— CNBC's Jesse Pound, Alex Harring, Michelle Fox and Sarah Min contributed reporting.\nGet Your Ticket to Pro LIVEJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange!Uncertain markets?
