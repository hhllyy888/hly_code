    "content": "key point \nThe U.S.-China tariff cuts, even if only for 90 days, address a major pain point: Christmas presents.\nNearly one-fifth of U.S. retail sales last year came from the Christmas holiday season, according to data from the National Retail Federation.\nStill, tariffs on certain products remain higher than before the additional duties kicked in during the escalation in trade tensions last month.\nFor running shoes produced in China, the total tariff is now 47%, still well above the 17% level in January, said Tony Post, CEO and founder of Massachusetts-based Topo Athletic.\nBEIJING â€” The U.S.-China tariff cuts, even if temporary, address a major pain point: Christmas presents.\nNearly a fifth of U.S. retail sales last year came from the Christmas holiday season, according to CNBC calculations based on data from the National Retail Federation. The period saw a 4% year-on-year sales increase to a record $994.1 billion.\n\"With the speed of Chinese factories, this 90-day window can resolve most of the product shortages for the U.S. Christmas season,\" Ryan Zhao, director at export-focused company Jiangsu Green Willow Textile said Monday in Chinese, translated by CNBC.\nHis company had paused production for U.S. clients last month. He expects orders to resume but not necessarily to the same levels as before the new tariffs kicked in since U.S. buyers have found alternatives to China-based suppliers in the last few weeks.\nU.S. retailers typically place orders months in advance, giving factories in China enough lead time to manufacture the products and ship them to reach the U.S. ahead of major holidays. The two global superpowers' sudden doubling of tariffs in early April forced some businesses to halt production, raising questions about whether supply chains would be able to resume work in time to get products on the shelves for Christmas."
