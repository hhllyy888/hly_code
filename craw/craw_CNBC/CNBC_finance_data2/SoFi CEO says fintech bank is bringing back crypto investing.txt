Customers, who had access to more than 20 crypto coins at the time, were either shunted to Blockchain.com or liquidated their holdings.\nBut after new guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the technology company is planning an aggressive push back into crypto, Noto told CNBC late Monday in an audio interview.\n\"We're going to re-enter the crypto business, which we had to exit,\" Noto said. \"We'll re-enter the business of allowing our members to invest in cryptocurrency. We want to actually make a bigger, more comprehensive push into cryptocurrency [this time], to include really providing crypto or blockchain capabilities in each product area that we have.\"\nThe SoFi announcement is early proof that banks are looking to push further into crypto in the Trump era. In January, the CEOs of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley said their institutions were ready to get involved in crypto. At the same time, crypto firms including Circle and BitGo are planning to apply for bank charters or licenses, further blurring the lines between traditional and digital finance.\nSoFi, which calls itself a \"one-stop shop\" for digital finance, on Tuesday posted first-quarter results that topped expectations, with the fastest revenue growth in more than a year. Unlike other companies being buffered by recession worries, SoFi also raised its guidance for 2025 revenue and earnings."
