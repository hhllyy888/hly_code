    "content": "key point \nDutch digital bank Bunq said Tuesday that it's applied for a broker-dealer license, in an initial step toward securing a full banking license.\nBunq will be able to offer most of its services in the U.S. with the exception of savings deposits after securing broker-dealer authorization.\nThe bank reported a 65% jump in profits year-on-year to 85.3 million euros ($97.2 million), boosted by an increase in interest income.\nDutch digital bank Bunq on Tuesday said it's filed for broker-dealer registration in the U.S. as it looks to further expand across the Atlantic.\nBunq CEO Ali Niknam said the broker-dealer application will be an initial step toward securing a full banking license. He couldn't offer a firm timeline for when Bunq will secure this authorization in the U.S. — but said he's excited for its growth prospects in the country.\nObtaining a broker-dealer license will mean Bunq \"can offer our users who have an international footprint — which is the user demography we're aiming for — a great number of our services,\" Niknam told CNBC. Bunq mainly caters for \"digital nomads,\" individuals who can live and work from anywhere remotely.\nBunq will be able to offer most of its services in the U.S. with the exception of a savings account after securing broker-dealer authorization, Niknam added.\nBunq, which touts itself as a bank for \"digital nomads,\" currently has a banking license in the European Union. It has applied for an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) in the U.K. Bunq previously had operations in Britain but forced to withdraw from the country in 2020 due to Brexit."
