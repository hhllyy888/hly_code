    "content": "key point \nThere are concerns about whether Christmas merchandise will be able to hit U.S. shelves in time for the holiday season.\nFor example, electronic products need to be shipped out of China by early September to hit U.S. shelves right after the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November.\nSome businesses are hedging their bets by partially refilling orders from China rather than enduring the sight of empty store shelves.\nFor years, Christmas merchandise has been hitting U.S. stores well ahead of the holidays, as retailers try to capitalize on the lucrative holiday season — a phenomenon known as \"Christmas creep.\" This year, however, retailers risk empty shelves during the holiday itself.\nTariffs could be the Grinch that disrupts year-end festivities, even as Chinese factories and their U.S. customers navigate tariff uncertainties to ensure that shelves stateside are well-stocked in time for Christmas.\nShortly after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on April 2 — including a 34% tariff on imports from China that were later ramped up to 145% — many U.S. retailers halted their orders from Chinese suppliers, forcing factories to pause production, according to CNBC interviews.\nHowever, industry representatives say that some production has restarted in the last few days, as businesses in the U.S. resume orders, with concerns over business disruptions and missed opportunities outweighing tariff uncertainties.\n\"If you don't start producing in the next couple of weeks, you're going to start missing Black Friday and Christmas,\" Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consulting firm Tidalwave Solutions, said in a phone interview Tuesday.\n\"Both sides are trying to be flexible to some degree,\" he said. \"Retailers are starting to realize if these supply chains stop, it will be much more difficult to get them up and running [again].\""
