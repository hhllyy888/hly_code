Major Wall Street banks have cut their China GDP forecasts for the year as a result, while the country still strives to achieve its lofty goal of \"around 5%\" growth set in March.\nAuthorities called for \"multiple measures to help businesses in difficulty,\" such as financial support, according to the Chinese-language readout, translated by CNBC.\nThe Politburo also called for \"timely reduction” of interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio — the amount of cash banks need to have on hand.\nPolicymakers are sticking with their stance from earlier this year, while indicating flexibility for targeted measures, said Zong Liang, chief researcher at Bank of China. For mitigating the impact of tariffs, he expects China will do more research on specific businesses, and consider how to support them."
