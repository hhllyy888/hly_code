    "content": "key point \nFed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that he expects President Donald Trump's tariffs to raise inflation and lower growth.\nPowell added the Fed faces a \"highly uncertain outlook\" because of the new reciprocal levies the president announced Wednesday, keeping the Fed on hold for interest rate moves.\n\"We are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance. It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy,\" he said.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that he expects President Donald Trump's tariffs to raise inflation and lower growth, and indicated that the central bank won't move on interest rates until it gets a clearer picture on the ultimate impacts.\nIn a speech delivered before business journalists in Arlington, Virginia, Powell said the Fed faces a \"highly uncertain outlook\" because of the new reciprocal levies the president announced Wednesday.\nThough he said the economy currently looks strong, he stressed the threat that tariffs pose and indicated that the Fed will be focused on keeping inflation in check.\n\"Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,\" Powell said in prepared remarks. \"We are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance. It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy.\"\nThe remarks came shortly after Trump called on Powell to \"stop playing politics\" and cut interest rates because inflation is down.\n\"I make it a practice not to respond to any elected officials comments, so I don't want to be seen to be doing that. It's just not appropriate for me,\" Powell said at the onset of a question-and-answer session following his speech.\nThere's been a torrent of selling on Wall Street following the Trump announcement of 10% across-the-board tariffs, along with a menu of reciprocal charges that are much higher for many key trading partners.\nPowell noted that the announced tariffs were \"significantly larger than expected.\"\n\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he said. \"The size and duration of these effects remain uncertain.\""
