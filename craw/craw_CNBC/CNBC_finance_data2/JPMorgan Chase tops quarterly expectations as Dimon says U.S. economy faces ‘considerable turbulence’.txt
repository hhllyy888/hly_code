Excluding a one-time gain of 16 cents per share tied to its First Republic acquisition, JPMorgan earned $4.91 per share, compared with the LSEG estimate of $4.61.\nRevenue rose 8% to $46.01 billion, helped by higher asset management and investment banking fees and strong trading results. As with rival Morgan Stanley, equities trading was the quarter's standout, with revenue surging 48% to $3.8 billion, topping the StreetAccount forecast by about $560 million.\nShares of the firm rose 4%.\nWhile JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon touted his company's solid results in the quarter, he also struck a note of caution on the broader economy. Markets have whipsawed violently since President Donald Trump escalated global trade tensions last week.\n\"The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and 'trade wars,' ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,\" Dimon said.\n\"As always, we hope for the best but prepare the Firm for a wide range of scenarios,\" he added.\nThe lack of certainty in the business environment for many companies was expected to cast a pall over some investment banking activities, including IPO listings and merger advice.\nBut it was also expected to provide a good environment for Wall Street trading desks to print money.\nWells Fargo and Morgan Stanley are also out with quarterly reports report Friday. Morgan Stanley similarly reported surging trading activity.\nGoldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup report next week."
