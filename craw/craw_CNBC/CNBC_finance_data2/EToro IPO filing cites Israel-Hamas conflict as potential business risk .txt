In the year and a half since then, the two sides have mostly been at war in the Gaza Strip, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed and much of the area has been made uninhabitable.\nTensions have also escalated with other designated militant groups in the region, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.\n\"It is possible that these hostilities will escalate in the future into a greater regional conflict, and that additional terrorist organizations and, possibly, countries, will actively join the hostilities,\" eToro wrote, adding that the magnitude of the conflict is \"difficult to predict.\"\nYoni Assia, eToro's CEO, told CNBC in an interview that the company's business is global, with operations worldwide. Regarding the challenges of being in Israel, Yoni Assia said \"everything is in the risk factors.\"\n\"We do hope to see more peaceful times,\" he said. \"It's better for everyone and for our employees from a business point of view.\""
