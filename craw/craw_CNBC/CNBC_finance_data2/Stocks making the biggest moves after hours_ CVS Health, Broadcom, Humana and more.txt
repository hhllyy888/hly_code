Humana gained more than 13%, while CVS Health and UnitedHealth advanced more than 7% and about 6%, respectively.\nLevi Strauss — The clothing stock rose more than 1% after the company reported its first-quarter results. Levi Strauss reported adjusted earnings of 38 cents per share, a 52% jump compared to the prior-year period. Revenue of $1.53 billion for the period also marked a 3% jump compared to last year.\nGreenbrier — Shares of the railcar manufacturer fell 4% on the back of the company dialing back its revenue guidance for the full year. Greenbrier now sees revenue ranging from $3.15 billion to $3.35 billion, compared to previous guidance of $3.35 billion to $3.65 billion.\nDave & Buster's — Shares of the owner and operator of entertainment and dining venues climbed nearly 2% on the heels of its fourth-quarter adjusted earnings, which came in at 69 cents per share. That is above the 67 cents per share that analysts polled by FactSet were expecting.
