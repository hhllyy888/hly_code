If this happens, China will not accept it and will resolutely take reciprocal countermeasures,\" the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said, according to a CNBC translation.\nBEIJING â€” China on Monday warned it will retaliate against countries that cooperate with the U.S. in ways that compromise Beijing's interests, as the trade war between the world's two largest economies threatens to embroil other nations.\nChina's warning comes as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is reportedly planning to use tariff negotiations to pressure U.S. partners to limit their dealings with China. Trump this month paused major tariff increases on other countries for 90 days, while hiking duties further on goods from China to 145%.\n\"China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests. If this happens, China will not accept it and will resolutely take reciprocal countermeasures,\" the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said, according to a CNBC translation.\nThe ministry cautioned about the risk to all countries once international trade returns to the \"law of the jungle.\"\nThe statement also sought to cast China as willing to work with all parties and \"defend international fairness and justice,\" while describing the U.S. actions as \"abusing tariffs\" and \"unilateral bullying.\""
