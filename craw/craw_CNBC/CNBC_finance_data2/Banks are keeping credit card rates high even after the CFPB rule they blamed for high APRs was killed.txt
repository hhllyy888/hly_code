Under previous Director Rohit Chopra, the CFPB estimated that its rule would save families $10 billion annually. Instead, it inadvertently saddled borrowers with higher rates and fees for receiving paper statements as credit card companies sought to offset the expected revenue hit.\nRetail cards hit a record high average interest rate of 30.5% last year, according to a Bankrate survey, and rates have stayed close to those levels this year.\n\"The companies have made a windfall,\" said David Silberman, a veteran banking attorney who lectures at Yale Law School. \"They didn't think they needed this revenue before except for [the CFPB rule], and they're now keeping it, which is coming directly out of the consumer's pocket.\"\nSynchrony and Bread both easily topped expectations for first-quarter profit, and analysts covering the companies have raised estimates for what they will earn this year, despite concerns about a looming U.S. economic slowdown."
