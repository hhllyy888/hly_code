    "content": "Wells Fargo shares declined on Friday after the bank reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue and a decline in net interest income.\nHere's what the bank posted for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\nShares of Wells Fargo fell 1% Friday after the results.\nIn the three-month period that ended March. 31, Wells Fargo's net income of $4.89 billion marked a 6% gain from $4.62 billion. Revenue fell 3% from $20.86 billion in the same quarter last year. Its adjusted EPS excluded a 6 cent gain from a previously announced sale of a third-party servicing segment, and it included discrete tax benefits and debt security losses.\nNet interest income, a key measure of what a bank makes on loans, fell 6% year over year to $11.50 billion. Noninterest income, which includes investment banking fees, brokerage commissions and advisory fees, rose 1% to $8.65 billion from last year's $8.64 billion.\nCEO Charlie Scharf highlighted the uncertainty in the economy brought on by the Trump administration's actions to reorient global trade, calling for a timely resolution.\n\"We support the administration's willingness to look at barriers to fair trade for the United States, though there are certainly risks associated with such significant actions,\" Scharf said in a statement. \"Timely resolution which benefits the U.S. would be good for businesses, consumers, and the markets. We expect continued volatility and uncertainty and are prepared for a slower economic environment in 2025, but the actual outcome will be dependent on the results and timing of the policy changes.\"\nWells Fargo bought back 44.5 million of its own shares, worth $3.5 billion, in first quarter.\nThe San Francisco-based lender set aside $932 million as provision for credit losses, which included a decrease in the allowance for credit losses.\nCorrection: Well Fargo's noninterest income was $8.64 billion in the year earlier quarter. An earlier version misstated the figure."
