Powell said that even with longer-term inflation expectations largely in line with the Fed's 2% target, the era of near-zero rates is not likely to return anytime soon.\n\"Higher real rates may also reflect the possibility that inflation could be more volatile going forward than in the inter-crisis period of the 2010s,\" Powell said in prepared remarks for the Thomas Laubach Research Conference in Washington, D.C. \"We may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks — a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks.\"\nThe Fed held its benchmark borrowing rate near zero for seven years following the financial crisis in 2008. Since December 2024, the overnight lending rate has been in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, most recently trading at 4.33%.\nThe \"supply shocks\" remarks are similar to those Powell has delivered over the past several weeks cautioning that policy changes could put the Fed in a difficult balancing act between supporting employment and controlling inflation.\nThough he did not mention President Donald Trump's tariffs in his Thursday remarks, the central bank chief in recent days has noted the likelihood that tariffs will slow growth and boost inflation. However, the extent of either impact is difficult to gauge, particularly as Trump recently has backed off the more aggressive duties pending a 90-day negotiating window.\nNevertheless, the Fed has been reluctant to ease policy after cutting its benchmark rate by a full percentage point last year."
