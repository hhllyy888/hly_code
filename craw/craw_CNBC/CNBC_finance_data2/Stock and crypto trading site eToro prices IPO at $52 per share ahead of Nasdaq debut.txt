The company had planned to sell shares at $46 to $50 each. Another almost 6 million shares are being sold by existing investors.\nIPOs looked poised for a rebound when President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January after a prolonged drought spurred by rising interest rates and inflationary concerns. CoreWeave's March debut was a welcome sign for IPO hopefuls such as eToro, online lender Klarna and ticket reseller StubHub.\nBut tariff uncertainty temporarily stalled those plans. The retail trading platform filed for an initial public offering in March, but shelved plans as rising tariff uncertainty rattled markets. Klarna and StubHub did the same.\nEToro's Nasdaq debut, under ticker symbol ETOR, may indicate whether the public market is ready to take on risk. Digital physical therapy company Hinge Health has started its IPO roadshow, and said in a filing on Tuesday that it plans to raise up to $437 million in its upcoming offering. Also on Tuesday, fintech company Chime filed its prospectus with the SEC.\nAnother trading app, Webull, merged with a special-purpose acquisition company in April.\nFounded in 2007 by brothers Yoni and Ronen Assia along with David Ring, eToro competes with the likes of Robinhood and makes money through fees related to trading, including spreads on buy and sell orders, and non-trading activities such as withdrawals and currency conversion.\nNet income jumped almost thirteenfold last year to $192.4 million from $15.3 million a year earlier. The company has been ramping up its crypto business, with revenue from cryptoassets more than tripling to over $12 million in 2024. One-quarter of its net trading contribution last year came from crypto, up from 10% the prior year.\nThis isn't eToro's first attempt at going public. In 2022, the company scrapped plans to hit the market through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) during a sharp downturn in equity markets. The deal would have valued the company at more than $10 billion.\nCEO Yoni Assia told CNBC early last year that eToro was still aiming for a market debut but \"evaluating the right opportunity\" as it was building relationships with exchanges, including the Nasdaq.\n\"We definitely are eyeing the public markets,\" he said at the time. \"I definitely see us becoming eventually a public company.\"\nEToro said in its prospectus that BlackRock had expressed interest in buying $100 million in shares at the IPO price. The company said it planned to sell 5 million shares in the offering, with existing investors and executives selling another 5 million.\nUnderwriters for the deal include Goldman Sachs, Jefferies and UBS.\n— CNBC's Ryan Browne and Jordan Novet contributed reporting\nWATCH: Venture capital firm founder on the Gulf's next wave of unicorns"
