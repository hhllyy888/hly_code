It will also indirectly acquire Discover Bank through the transaction, which was approved by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Friday.\nUnder the agreement, Discover shareholders will receive 1.0192 Capital One shares for each Discover share or about a 26% premium from Discover's closing price of $110.49 at the time, Capital One said in a release.\nCapital One and Discover are among the largest credit card issuers in the U.S., and the merger will expand Capital One's deposit base and its credit card offerings.\nAs a condition of the merger, Capital One said it will comply with the Fed's action against Discover, according to the release. The Fed fined Discover $100 million for overcharging certain interchange fees from 2007 through 2023, and the company is repaying those fees to affected customers.\nThe OCC said it approved Capital One's application on the condition that it would take \"corrective actions\" to remediate harm and address the \"root causes\" of outstanding enforcement actions against Discover.\nAfter the deal closes, Capital One shareholders will hold 60% of the combined company, while Discover shareholders own 40%, according to the February 2024 release.\nIn a joint statement, Capital One and Discover said they expect to close the deal on May 18.\nWATCH: Jamie Dimon on Capital One’s $35.3 billion Discover acquisition: ‘Let them compete’"
