    "content": "key point \nThe energy efficient home improvement tax credit offers taxpayers up to $3,200 per year to offset the cost of projects like installing a heat pump or insulation. \nThe Inflation Reduction Act extended the tax break through 2032 and made it more generous. \nRepublicans may kill the tax credit as part of a multitrillion-dollar tax-cut package being hashed out on Capitol Hill. \nMegan Moritz bought her dream house in 2019.\nHowever, the 1,400-square-foot home, in the Arlington Heights suburb northwest of Chicago, was built in the 1930s and lacked insulation — leading to heating bills that were \"very high,\" said Moritz, 48.\nThe first-time homeowner opted to pay about $5,700 for a series of projects last year to make her home more energy-efficient. She added insulation to the walls, and sealed gaps in ductwork connected to her furnace to prevent air leaks.\nMoritz shaved her gas heating bill by half or more during the winter months, and her home is now \"delightfully toasty,\" she said. She slashed her bill to $102 in December 2024 from $311 two years earlier, records show. In January 2025, her bill was $116, down from $288 in 2023.\nMoritz also received a $1,200 federal tax break when she filed her tax return this year, according to records reviewed by CNBC. She's among millions of homeowners who claim a tax credit each year for retrofits tied to energy efficiency.\nMore from Personal Finance:Can't pay your taxes by April 15? You have optionsThere's another surprise tax deadline on April 15This tax strategy is a 'silver lining' amid tariff volatility\n\"The biggest perk to me, honestly, was not freezing my butt off,\" said Moritz, who works for a global professional association. \"Then it was the monthly bill going down as much as it did.\"\n\"The tax credit was a nice little perk, the cherry on top,\" she said.\nThe tax break, however, may not be available for much longer.\nRepublicans have signaled an intent to put the tax break and other consumer financial incentives linked to the Inflation Reduction Act on the chopping block to raise money for a multi-trillion-dollar package of tax cuts being negotiated on Capitol Hill."
