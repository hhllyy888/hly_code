The move comes as Tether, once accused of being a criminal's 'go-to cryptocurrency' – rebrands itself as a partner to American lawmakers and law enforcement.\n\"A domestic stablecoin would be different from the international stable coin,\" Ardoino told CNBC's Dan Murphy at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on Wednesday. \"It depends on the timeline of the final legislation… but we are looking at that by the end of the year, or early next year at the fastest,\" he said.\nBut the timing and tactics of that next step are raising eyebrows on Capitol Hill.\nArdoino's recent charm offensive in Washington, which included private meetings with lawmakers, a Capitol Hill lunch with Senator Bill Hagerty and parties with crypto insiders, according to a New York Times report, has put a spotlight on Tether amid the pro-crypto shift under President Trump.\nThat influence may now be helping shape key legislation, including the GOP-backed GENIUS Act, which critics say includes loopholes that benefit Tether and other foreign issuers – such as provisions allowing operations in the U.S. if they agree to work with law enforcement."
